More positive differential epistases under environmental
perturbations. (A) Heat maps describe the global dynamics of
differential epistasis from abundant-glucose medium to ethanol (left
panel) and glycerol (right panel) conditions. Only gene pairs with
$\left|\D\epsilon\right| \geq 0.01$ in either condition are included
in the figure. Different colors represent differential epistasis
values as indicated by the color bar at the bottom. The differential
epistasis values are assigned to be 0.1 (or -0.1) in the heat-maps
when it is greater than 0.1 (or less than -0.1). It is noteworthy to
point out that the epistasis patterns are indeed very different
between the two conditions (Fig 2A). (B) Percentage of positive and
negative differential epistases under ethanol and glycerol
conditions. (C) Ratio of positive to negative differential epistases
in each simulated condition. The result from a high-throughput
experiment is also shown. The letters A-P represent acetaldehyde,
acetate, adenosine 3',5'-bisphosphate, adenosyl methionine, adenosine,
alanine, allantoin, arginine, ethanol, glutamate, glutamine, glycerol,
low glucose, phosphate, trehalose, and xanthosine, respectively.

Epistasis dynamics between environmental perturbations. (A) Number of
gene pairs with various epistatic relationships between ethanol and
glycerol growth conditions. (B) The distribution for the percentages
of gene pairs with similar epistasis relation between any 2 of 16
conditions. The frequency is derived from the 120 pairs of
environmental conditions simulated in this study.

\newcommand{\eeFBAfigThreeCap}{%
The global distribution of epistatic relations under simulated
conditions. (A) Distribution for the number of conditions in which
each epistatic interaction exists. Note that $\approx$~28\% of
epistatic relations are extremely stable (the very right bar) and
$\approx$~24\% are extremely dynamic (the very left bar). (B) Fraction
of three types of epistatic relations in each of the 16 environmental
perturbations, as indicated by the color bar to the right. The numbers
in the brackets represent the number of conditions in which each
epistatic interaction exists, as indicated in (A). The letters A-P
represent the simulated conditions as indicated in Figure 1.

Network properties for the extremely stable and extremely dynamic
epistatic interactions. (A) Degree distribution for genes in two
epistatic interaction networks. The networks have nodes that
correspond to genes and edges that correspond to epistatic
interactions. (B) Three network parameters (the definition of which
are shown in Methods) for two epistatic interaction networks.

Co-evolution between genes with epistasis. (A) Average evolutionary
rate differences between gene pairs with FBA-predicted epistasis
(green), extremely dynamic epistasis (blue) and extremely stable
epistasis (red) are highlighted by three arrows, respectively. The
random simulations with the same number of gene pairs as each of the
three groups were repeated 10,000 times and the frequency
distributions are shown (marked by the same colors as the
corresponding arrows, respectively). (B) The evolutionary rates for
genes that are involved in extremely stable and extremely dynamic
epistasis, respectively. The error bars represent standard errors.
