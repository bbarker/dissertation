The literature so far has been remarkably biased in the simulation of only
deleterious mutants rather than beneficial mutants in the constraint-based modeling
literature. This has numerous reasons, but it is undoubtedly due largely to 
the absence of a notion of any improvement in the objecitve function when a global optimum
is found. 

\section{Introduction to Adaptive Mutations}
Biologists have long wondered the extent to which evolution occurs due to nearly neutral 
and slighly deleterious mutations, or adaptive mutations, or more complex situations involving
these types of mutations as well as their epistatic interactions (cite the work of Kimura etc.).
 
\subsection{Adaptive Mutations and Epistasis}

\subsection{The Need for a New Modeling Framework}
Clearly, using FBA with the growth objective alone is not enough--we only ever get the 
optimum for our fitness objective.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The occurence of beneficial mutations and how they affect adaptation
is currently an area of active interest in evolutionary biology
\cite{Chou2011} \cite{Weinreich2006}. The questions are often
difficult or impossible to assess experimentally due to limited
resources.  In genome-scale models, to our knowledge, only microbial
epistasis has so far been studied for all enzymes (often referred to
as genome-scale in this context). This is due to several factors.

One issue is that these computations can still take a significant
amount of time, and the increase in model size of Human Recon 2 over
Yeast can cause even a relatively simple FBA run to go up by an order
of magnitude.  This problem is compounded by the increase in the
number of genes in the human model, since computing epistasis consumes
space and time as $O(n^2)$ where $n$ is the number of genes in the
model. More important than this issue, which might be overcome with
enough computational resources, is the issue of an objective
function. It has been shown numerous times that FBA with a biomass
objective can be a reasonable approximation to what a microbe is
trying to achieve metabolically
~\cite{Schuetz2012}~\cite{Fong2004}~\cite{Varma1994} . While Recon 2
is equipped with a ``generalized biomass reaction'', it is not clear
what the meaning of this is, and it certainly seems unlikely to
estimate the metabolism even of fast-growing cancer cells \hl{(cite
  Locasale?)}. We propose FALCON as a method to get around this issue
for non-microbial models.

Another advantage of FALCON is that it allows one to directly probe
mutations that are represented as gene expresion perturbations. A
decreased level of gene expression may also be metabolically
equivalent to the effect of a missense mutation, for example. This
allows a different sampling strategy than before; for instance, we
could observe how uniform expression restriction compares to uniform
flux restriction~\cite{Xu2012}. Assuming an accurate model of
enzyme-complex expression measurement, the former should be the more
realistic model.

One issue discussed elsewhere is that combining traditional flux
restriction mutations, which are known as \emph{hard constraints}, may
result in an unsolvable system, which is almost certainly an undesired
effect of this mutation modeling formalism. Instead, it would be
better if mutations could be modeled as \emph{soft
  constraints}. Concretely, whereas hard constraints are enacted in
the actual constraints of the optimization problem, soft constraints
merely change the objective. This means that multiple soft constaints
combined together under some mutational model would be compatible in
the sense that they wouldn't unexpectedly result in an unsolvable
system. FALCON provides two possible avenues for soft constraints:
expression level and expression variation. \emph{However, it is not
  clear yet what expression variation really means, so further
  investigation is necessary.}
