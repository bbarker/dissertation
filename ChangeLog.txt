7/25/2014 (Changes since initial draft)

* Added github repository information for FALCON.

* Made some figures larger in Chapter 5.

* Acknowledgements added to FALCON paper (Chapter 4).

* Removed min-disjunction algorithm, since it is 
  essentially a couple of superficial changes to the standard
  CNF conversion algorithm. Instead, we now simply describe
  these changes and reference a textbook.

* Removed heuristic min-disjunction algorithm, as it is
  complicated, ended up being unnecessary, and is troublesome to
  really measure how bad it can be compared to the standard
  CNF conversion approach.
