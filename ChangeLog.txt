Chapter 1:

Chapter 2:

Chapter 3:

Chapter 4:

* Moved FALCON algorithm from appendix to chapter.

* Many clarifications to FALCON algorithm, including making
  the algorithm pseudocode more self contained, and 
  provided explicit inputs and outputs.

* Removed min-disjunction algorithm, since it is 
  essentially a couple of superficial changes to the standard
  CNF conversion algorithm. Instead, we now simply describe
  these changes and reference a textbook.

* Removed heuristic min-disjunction algorithm, as it is
  complicated, ended up being unnecessary, and is troublesome to
  really measure how bad it can be compared to the standard
  CNF conversion approach.

* Added github repository information for FALCON.

* Acknowledgements added.

Chapter 5:

* Made some figures larger.
