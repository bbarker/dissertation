7/25/2014 (Changes since initial draft)

Chapter 1:

* Removed errant template sentence from abstract.

Chapter 2:

Chapter 3:

Chapter 4:

* Fixed several typos.

* Several improvements for clarity in writing, including
  better reference placement, more thorough introduction,
  description of constraint sets, and removal of some
  unnecessary comments. 

* Moved FALCON algorithm from appendix to chapter.

* Many clarifications to FALCON algorithm, including making
  the algorithm pseudocode more self contained, and 
  provided explicit inputs and outputs.

* Added an assumption about post-translational modification.

* Removed min-disjunction algorithm, since it is 
  essentially a couple of superficial changes to the standard
  CNF conversion algorithm. Instead, we now simply describe
  these changes and reference a textbook.

* Removed heuristic min-disjunction algorithm, as it is
  complicated, ended up being unnecessary, and is troublesome to
  really measure how bad it can be compared to the standard
  CNF conversion approach.

* Added example showing how conversion to CNF and taking the 
  minimum disjunction removes redundant holoenzymes.

* In discussing the ATP Synthase complex example, now
  correctly reference the right assumption instead of
  confusingly stating "discussed above".

* Added github repository information for FALCON.

* Acknowledgments added.

Chapter 5:

* Made some figures larger.
