\section*{Abstract}

Epistasis describes the phenomenon that mutations at different loci do
not have independent effects with regard to certain
phenotypes. Understanding the global epistatic landscape is vital for
many genetic and evolutionary theories. Current knowledge for
epistatic dynamics under multiple conditions is limited by the
technological difficulties in experimentally screening epistatic
relations among genes. We explored this issue by applying flux balance
analysis to simulate epistatic landscapes under various
environmental perturbations. Specifically, we looked at gene-gene
epistatic interactions, where the mutations were assumed to occur in
different genes. We predicted that epistasis tends to become more
positive from glucose-abundant to nutrient-limiting conditions,
indicating that selection might be less effective in removing
deleterious mutations in the latter. We also observed a stable core of
epistatic interactions in all tested conditions, as well as many
epistatic interactions unique to each condition. Interestingly, genes
in the stable epistatic interaction network are directly linked to
most other genes whereas genes with condition-specific epistasis form
a scale-free network. Furthermore, genes with stable epistasis tend to
have similar evolutionary rates, whereas this co-evolving relationship
does not hold for genes with condition-specific epistasis. Our
findings provide a novel genome-wide picture about epistatic dynamics
under environmental perturbations.

{\bf More positive differential epistases under environmental
perturbations.} (\textbf{A}) Heat maps describe the global dynamics of
differential epistasis from abundant-glucose medium to ethanol (left
panel) and glycerol (right panel) conditions. Only gene pairs with
$\left|\D\epsilon\right| \geq 0.01$ in either condition are included
in the figure. Different colors represent differential epistasis
values as indicated by the color bar at the bottom. The differential
epistasis values are assigned to be 0.1 (or -0.1) in the heat-maps
when it is greater than 0.1 (or less than -0.1). It is noteworthy to
point out that the epistasis patterns are indeed very different
between the two conditions (\Fig~\ref{fig:eef2}A). (\textbf{B})
Percentage of positive and negative differential epistases under
ethanol and glycerol conditions. (\textbf{C}) Ratio of positive to
negative differential epistases
in each simulated condition. The result from a high-throughput
experiment is also shown. The letters A-P represent acetaldehyde,
acetate, adenosine 3',5'-bisphosphate, adenosyl methionine, adenosine,
alanine, allantoin, arginine, ethanol, glutamate, glutamine, glycerol,
low glucose, phosphate, trehalose, and xanthosine, respectively.

of gene pairs with similar epistasis relation between any 2 of 16

about 24\% are extremely dynamic (the very left bar). (\textbf{B}) Fraction
of three types of epistatic relations in each of the 16 environmental
perturbations, as indicated by the color bar to the right. The numbers
in the brackets represent the number of conditions in which each

epistasis (red) are highlighted by three arrows, respectively. The
random simulations with the same number of gene pairs as each of the
three groups were repeated 10,000 times and the frequency
distributions are shown (marked by the same colors as the
corresponding arrows, respectively). (\textbf{B}) The evolutionary rates for
genes that are involved in extremely stable and extremely dynamic
epistasis, respectively. The error bars represent standard errors.
