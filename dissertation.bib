  abstract	= {An important goal of whole-cell computational modeling is
		  to integrate detailed biochemical information with
		  biological intuition to produce testable predictions. Based
		  on the premise that prokaryotes such as Escherichia coli
		  have maximized their growth performance along evolution,
		  flux balance analysis (FBA) predicts metabolic flux
		  distributions at steady state by using linear programming.
		  Corroborating earlier results, we show that recent
		  intracellular flux data for wild-type E. coli JM101 display
		  excellent agreement with FBA predictions. Although the
		  assumption of optimality for a wild-type bacterium is
		  justifiable, the same argument may not be valid for
		  genetically engineered knockouts or other bacterial strains
		  that were not exposed to long-term evolutionary pressure.
		  We address this point by introducing the method of
		  minimization of metabolic adjustment (MOMA), whereby we
		  test the hypothesis that knockout metabolic fluxes undergo
		  a minimal redistribution with respect to the flux
		  configuration of the wild type. MOMA employs quadratic
		  programming to identify a point in flux space, which is
		  closest to the wild-type point, compatibly with the gene
		  deletion constraint. Comparing MOMA and FBA predictions to
		  experimental flux data for E. coli pyruvate kinase mutant
		  PB25, we find that MOMA displays a significantly higher
		  correlation than FBA. Our method is further supported by
		  experimental data for E. coli knockout growth rates. It can
		  therefore be used for predicting the behavior of perturbed
		  metabolic networks, whose growth performance is in general
		  suboptimal. MOMA and its possible future extensions may be
		  useful in understanding the evolutionary optimization of
		  metabolism.},

  abstract	= {Flux balance models of metabolism use stoichiometry of
		  metabolic pathways, metabolic demands of growth, and
		  optimality principles to predict metabolic flux
		  distribution and cellular growth under specified
		  environmental conditions. These models have provided a
		  mechanistic interpretation of systemic metabolic
		  physiology, and they are also useful as a quantitative tool
		  for metabolic pathway design. Quantitative predictions of
		  cell growth and metabolic by-product secretion that are
		  experimentally testable can be obtained from these models.
		  In the present report, we used independent measurements to
		  determine the model parameters for the wild-type
		  Escherichia coli strain W3110. We experimentally determined
		  the maximum oxygen utilization rate (15 mmol of O2 per g
		  [dry weight] per h), the maximum aerobic glucose
		  utilization rate (10.5 mmol of Glc per g [dry weight] per
		  h), the maximum anaerobic glucose utilization rate (18.5
		  mmol of Glc per g [dry weight] per h), the
		  non-growth-associated maintenance requirements (7.6 mmol of
		  ATP per g [dry weight] per h), and the growth-associated
		  maintenance requirements (13 mmol of ATP per g of biomass).
		  The flux balance model specified by these parameters was
		  found to quantitatively predict glucose and oxygen uptake
		  rates as well as acetate secretion rates observed in
		  chemostat experiments. We have formulated a predictive
		  algorithm in order to apply the flux balance model to
		  describe unsteady-state growth and by-product secretion in
		  aerobic batch, fed-batch, and anaerobic batch cultures. In
		  aerobic experiments we observed acetate secretion,
		  accumulation in the culture medium, and reutilization from
		  the culture medium. In fed-batch cultures acetate is
		  cometabolized with glucose during the later part of the
		  culture period.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

  abstract	= {Epistasis refers to the phenomenon in which phenotypic
		  consequences caused by mutation of one gene depend on one
		  or more mutations at another gene. Epistasis is critical
		  for understanding many genetic and evolutionary processes,
		  including pathway organization, evolution of sexual
		  reproduction, mutational load, ploidy, genomic complexity,
		  speciation, and the origin of life. Nevertheless, current
		  understandings for the genome-wide distribution of
		  epistasis are mostly inferred from interactions among one
		  mutant type per gene, whereas how epistatic interaction
		  partners change dynamically for different mutant alleles of
		  the same gene is largely unknown. Here we address this
		  issue by combining predictions from flux balance analysis
		  and data from a recently published high-throughput
		  experiment. Our results show that different alleles can
		  epistatically interact with very different gene sets.
		  Furthermore, between two random mutant alleles of the same
		  gene, the chance for the allele with more severe mutational
		  consequence to develop a higher percentage of negative
		  epistasis than the other allele is 50∼70\% in eukaryotic
		  organisms, but only 20∼30\% in bacteria and archaea. We
		  developed a population genetics model that predicts that
		  the observed distribution for the sign of epistasis can
		  speed up the process of purging deleterious mutations in
		  eukaryotic organisms. Our results indicate that epistasis
		  among genes can be dynamically rewired at the genome level,
		  and call on future efforts to revisit theories that can
		  integrate epistatic dynamics among genes in biological
