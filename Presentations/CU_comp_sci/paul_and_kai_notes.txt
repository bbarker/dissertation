If keeping the background slide, try to make it a good story and funny. 

  (Maybe remove bullet point iteration in this one.)
  (Try to bring up themes in story (efficiency, communication, etc.))


In talking about metabolic systems complexity, be sure to tell them how important modeling complex
systems can be in both research and in the systems environment. 

*** Introduce why we want to use constraint based modeling before going over FBA example.
Iteratively show images.

Be very careful about clearly and easily explaining equations.

Be *sure* to give microbiral growth maximization example.


  (Selling points for each point in the algorithm pipeline, 
  change title to show solution oriented approach.)

  (Subtitles above code as main innovation for each part.
  (efficient, accurate efficient).)

  (For 2nd flowchart: falcon: an iterative approach to flux estimation.
  "Call solver" instead of "Call LP solver".)


  (Simplifly 2nd flowchart, possibly merge with bullets to show innovations.)
