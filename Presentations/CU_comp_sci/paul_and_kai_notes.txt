Talk somewhere about how my experience with complex systems will make
dealing with most problems relatively easy, or something.

  (If keeping the background slide, try to make it a good story and funny. )

  (Maybe remove bullet point iteration in this one.)
  (Try to bring up themes in story (efficiency, communication, etc.))


  (In talking about metabolic systems complexity, be sure to tell them
  how important modeling complex) systems can be in both research and
  in the systems environment.

  (Be very careful about clearly and easily explaining equations.)

  (Selling points for each point in the algorithm pipeline, 
  change title to show solution oriented approach.)

  (Subtitles above code as main innovation for each part.
  (efficient, accurate efficient).)

  (For 2nd flowchart: falcon: an iterative approach to flux estimation.
  "Call solver" instead of "Call LP solver".)


  (Simplifly 2nd flowchart, possibly merge with bullets to show innovations.)
