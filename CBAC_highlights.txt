A new algorithm can estimate enzyme abundance using gene-protein-reaction rules.
A new algorithm uses enzyme abundance to quickly estimate fluxes.
The flux estimates enjoy comparably superior predictivity and good robustness.
Software packages with modular implementations are available for the algorithms.
