  abstract  = "One of the key ways in which microbes are thought to regulate
               their metabolism is by modulating the availability of enzymes
               through transcriptional regulation. However, the limited success
               of efforts to manipulate metabolic fluxes by rewiring the
               transcriptional network has cast doubt on the idea that
               transcript abundance controls metabolic fluxes. In this study,
               we investigate control of metabolic flux in the model bacterium
               Bacillus subtilis by quantifying fluxes, transcripts, and
               metabolites in eight metabolic states enforced by different
               environmental conditions. We find that most enzymes whose flux
               switches between on and off states, such as those involved in
               substrate uptake, exhibit large corresponding transcriptional
               changes. However, for the majority of enzymes in central
               metabolism, enzyme concentrations were insufficient to explain
               the observed fluxes[mdash]only for a number of reactions in the
               tricarboxylic acid cycle were enzyme changes approximately
               proportional to flux changes. Surprisingly, substrate changes
               revealed by metabolomics were also insufficient to explain
               observed fluxes, leaving a large role for allosteric regulation
               and enzyme modification in the control of metabolic fluxes.",

              The annotated sequence, biochemical information, and other

              The stoichiometric coefficients for each metabolic enzyme in the
              E. coli metabolic map were assembled to construct a
              genome-specific stoichiometric matrix. The E. coli stoichiometric
              matrix was used to define the system's characteristics and the

              It was shown that based on stoichiometric and capacity

              predict the growth potential of mutant strains in 86\% of the

              thermodynamics-based metabolic flux analysis (TMFA) is introduced
              with the capability of generating thermodynamically feasible flux
              and metabolite activity profiles on a genome scale. TMFA involves
              the use of a set of linear thermodynamic constraints in addition
              to the mass balance constraints typically used in MFA. TMFA
              produces flux distributions that do not contain any
              thermodynamically infeasible reactions or pathways, and it
              provides information about the free energy change of reactions
              and the range of metabolite activities in addition to reaction
              fluxes. TMFA is applied to study the thermodynamically feasible
              ranges for the fluxes and the Gibbs free energy change,
              Delta(r)G', of the reactions and the activities of the
              metabolites in the genome-scale metabolic model of Escherichia
              coli developed by Palsson and co-workers. In the TMFA of the
              genome scale model, the metabolite activities and reaction
              Delta(r)G' are able to achieve a wide range of values at optimal
              growth. The reaction dihydroorotase is identified as a possible
              thermodynamic bottleneck in E. coli metabolism with a Delta(r)G'
              constrained close to zero while numerous reactions are identified
              throughout metabolism for which Delta(r)G' is always highly
              negative regardless of metabolite concentrations. As it has been
              proposed previously, these reactions with exclusively negative
              Delta(r)G' might be candidates for cell regulation, and we find
              that a significant number of these reactions appear to be the
              first steps in the linear portion of numerous biosynthesis
              pathways. The thermodynamically feasible ranges for the
              concentration ratios ATP/ADP, NAD(P)/NAD(P)H, and
              H(extracellular)(+)/H(intracellular)(+) are also determined and
              found to encompass the values observed experimentally in every
              case. Further, we find that the NAD/NADH and NADP/NADPH ratios
              maintained in the cell are close to the minimum feasible ratio

              brain in vivo by 1H-observed, 13C-edited (POCE) nuclear magnetic

              during a 60-min infusion of [1-13C]glucose. Complete time courses
              were obtained from six animals. The measured intensity of the
              unresolved [4-13CH2] resonances of glutamate and glutamine
              increased exponentially during the infusion and attained a steady
              state in approximately 20 min with a first-order rate constant of
              0.130 +/- 0.010 min-1 (t1/2 = 5.3 +/- 0.5 min). The appearance of
              the [3-13CH2] resonance in the POCE difference spectrum lagged
              behind that of the [4-13CH2] resonance and had not reached steady
              state at the end of the 60-min infusion (t1/2 = 26.6 +/- 4.1
              min). The increase observed in 13C-labeled glutamate represented
              isotopic enrichment and was not due to a change in the total
              glutamate concentration. The glucose infusion did not affect the
              levels of high-energy phosphates or intracellular pH as

              the rate of glutamate labeling provided an estimate of TCA cycle

              1) a poorly defined pyruvate input and 2) low levels of

              sequence information into biological knowledge, hence
              computational analysis tools are continuously being developed for
              rapid genome annotation and interpretation. Among the earliest,
              most comprehensive resources for prokaryotic genome analysis, the
              SEED project, initiated in 2003 as an integration of genomic data
              and analysis tools, now contains >5,000 complete genomes, a
              constantly updated set of curated annotations embodied in a large
              and growing collection of encoded subsystems, a derived set of
              protein families, and hundreds of genome-scale metabolic models.
              Until recently, however, maintaining current copies of the SEED
              code and data at remote locations has been a pressing issue. To
              allow high-performance remote access to the SEED database, we
              developed the SEED Servers (http://www.theseed.org/servers): four
              network-based servers intended to expose the data in the
              underlying relational database, support basic annotation
              services, offer programmatic access to the capabilities of the
              RAST annotation server, and provide access to a growing
              collection of metabolic models that support flux balance
              analysis. The SEED servers offer open access to regularly updated
              data, the ability to annotate prokaryotic genomes, the ability to
              create metabolic reconstructions and detailed models of
              metabolism, and access to hundreds of existing metabolic models.
              This work offers and supports a framework upon which other groups
              can build independent research efforts. Large integrations of
              genomic data represent one of the major intellectual resources
              driving research in biology, and programmatic access to the SEED

              cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen utilization (CMR(O2)) and
              cerebral blood flow (CBF), are not thoroughly established.
              CMR(O2) is closely coupled to the rate of tricarboxylic acid
              (TCA) cycle flux. In this study, the changes in glutamate
              labeling during (13)C labeled glucose administration were
              determined in the human brain as an index of alterations in
              neuronal TCA cycle turnover during increased neuronal activity.
              Two-volume (1)H-[(13)C] MR spectroscopy (MRS) of the visual
              cortex was combined with functional MRI (fMRI) at 4 Tesla.
              Hemifield visual stimulation was employed to obtain data
              simultaneously from activated and control regions located
              symmetrically in the two hemispheres of the brain. The results
              showed that the fractional change in the turnover rate of C4
              carbon of glutamate was less than that of CBF during visual
              stimulation. The fractional changes in CMR(O2) (Delta CMR(O2))
              induced by activation must be equal to or less than the
              fractional change in glutamate labeling kinetics. Therefore, the
              results impose an upper limit of approximately 30\% for Delta
              CMR(O2) and demonstrate: 1) that fractional CBF increases exceed
              Delta CMR(O2) during elevated activity in the visual cortex, and
              2) that such an unequal change would explain the observed
              positive blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) effect in fMRI.

              Proc. Syst. Biol. 1(1), 114-120], we are now considering the
              general case of double and multiple knockouts. The robustness
              measures are based on the ratio of the number of remaining EFMs
              after knockout vs. the number of EFMs in the unperturbed
              situation, averaged over all combinations of knockouts. With the
              help of simple examples we demonstrate that consideration of
              multiple knockouts yields additional information going beyond
              single-knockout results. It is proven that the robustness score
              decreases as the knockout depth increases. We apply our extended

              severalfold while maintaining energy species (e.g., ATP, ADP, and
              Pi) concentrations constant; however, the mechanisms that
              regulate this response are unclear. Limited experimental studies
              show that the classic regulatory species NADH and NAD+ are also
              maintained nearly constant with increased cardiac power
              generation, but current measurements lump the cytosol and
              mitochondria and do not provide dynamic information during the
              early phase of the transition from low to high work states. In
              the present study, we modified our previously published
              computational model of cardiac metabolism by incorporating
              parallel activation of ATP hydrolysis, glycolysis, mitochondrial
              dehydrogenases, the electron transport chain, and oxidative
              phosphorylation, and simulated the metabolic responses of the
              heart to an abrupt increase in energy expenditure. Model
              simulations showed that myocardial oxygen consumption, pyruvate
              oxidation, fatty acids oxidation, and ATP generation were all
              increased with increased energy expenditure, whereas ATP and ADP
              remained constant. Both cytosolic and mitochondrial NADH/NAD+
              increased during the first minutes (by 40\% and 20\%,
              respectively) and returned to the resting values by 10-15 min.
              Furthermore, model simulations showed that an altered substrate
              selection, induced by either elevated arterial lactate or
              diabetic conditions, affected cytosolic NADH/NAD+ but had minimal
              effects on the mitochondrial NADH/NAD+, myocardial oxygen

              support the concept of parallel activation of metabolic processes
              generating reducing equivalents during an abrupt increase in
              cardiac energy expenditure and suggest there is a transient

              alpha-hydroxyglutarate, isocitrate, and glutamine before mass
              spectrometric analysis. General equations have been developed
              ({"}Appendix I{"}) to determine the isotopic enrichment of each
              carbon of glutamate from the isotopic enrichment of fragments
              obtained from the mass spectra of trimethylsilyl or
              t-butyldimethylsilyl derivatives of glutamate and of derived
              compounds ({"}Appendix II{"}). In the presence of octanoate, (i)
              the rate of the citric acid cycle decreases from 0.25 to 0.13
              mumol/min x g wet weight which are one-third and one-sixth of the

              gluconeogenesis increases from 0.65 to 0.83 mumol/min x g wet
              weight. The rate of pyruvate carboxylation is 13 and 34-fold
              faster than that of pyruvate dehydrogenation in the absence or
              presence of octanoate, respectively. The rate of oxaloacetate to
              fumarate interconversion is at least six times greater than that
              of the citric acid cycle. Our data closely agree with those

  abstract = "Prediction of metabolic changes that result from genetic or
              environmental perturbations has several important applications,
              including diagnosing metabolic disorders and discovering novel
              drug targets. A cardinal challenge in obtaining accurate
              predictions is the integration of transcriptional regulatory
              networks with the corresponding metabolic network. We propose a
              method called probabilistic regulation of metabolism (PROM) that
              achieves this synthesis and enables straightforward, automated,
              and quantitative integration of high-throughput data into
              constraint-based modeling, making it an ideal tool for
              constructing genome-scale regulatory-metabolic network models for
              less-studied organisms. PROM introduces probabilities to
              represent gene states and gene-transcription factor interactions.
              By using PROM, we constructed an integrated regulatory-metabolic
              network for the model organism, Escherichia coli, and
              demonstrated that our method based on automated inference is more
              accurate and comprehensive than the current state of the art,
              which is based on manual curation of literature. After validating
              the approach, we used PROM to build a genome-scale integrated
              metabolic-regulatory model for Mycobacterium tuberculosis, a
              critically important human pathogen. This study incorporated data
              from more than 1,300 microarrays, 2,000 transcription
              factor-target interactions regulating 3,300 metabolic reactions,
              and 1,905 KO phenotypes for E. coli and M. tuberculosis. PROM
              identified KO phenotypes with accuracies as high as 95\%, and
              predicted growth rates quantitatively with correlation of 0.95.
              Importantly, PROM represents the successful integration of a
              top-down reconstructed, statistically inferred regulatory network
              with a bottom-up reconstructed, biochemically detailed metabolic
              network, bridging two important classes of systems biology models

              physiological information about the organism. Mathematical
              analysis can be performed to assess the capabilities of these
              reconstructed networks. The constraints-based framework, with
              flux balance analysis (FBA), has been used successfully to
              predict time course of growth and by-product secretion, effects
              of mutation and knock-outs, and gene expression profiles.
              However, FBA leads to incorrect predictions in situations where
              regulatory effects are a dominant influence on the behavior of
              the organism. Thus, there is a need to include regulatory events
              within FBA to broaden its scope and predictive capabilities. Here
              we represent transcriptional regulatory events as time-dependent
              constraints on the capabilities of a reconstructed metabolic

              in work rate - a phenomenon that has eluded mechanistic
              explanation for decades - data from (31)phosphate-magnetic
              resonance spectroscopy ((31)P-MRS) are analysed to estimate
              cytoplasmic and mitochondrial phosphate metabolite concentrations
              in the normal state, during high cardiac workstates, during acute

              simulating distributed heterogeneous oxygen transport in the
              myocardium integrated with a detailed model of cardiac energy
              metabolism. The model predicts that baseline myocardial free
              inorganic phosphate (P(i)) concentration in the canine myocyte
              cytoplasm - a variable not accessible to direct non-invasive
              measurement - is approximately 0.29 mm and increases to 2.3 mm
              near maximal cardiac oxygen consumption. During acute ischaemia
              (from ligation of the left anterior descending artery) P(i)
              increases to approximately 3.1 mm and ATP consumption in the
              ischaemic tissue is reduced quickly to less than half its
              baseline value before the creatine phosphate (CrP) pool is 18\%
              depleted. It is determined from these experiments that the
              maximal rate of oxygen consumption of the heart is an emergent
              property and is limited not simply by the maximal rate of ATP
              synthesis, but by the maximal rate at which ATP can be
              synthesized at a potential at which it can be utilized. The
              critical free energy of ATP hydrolysis for cardiac contraction
              that is consistent with these findings is approximately -63.5 kJ
              mol(-1). Based on theoretical findings, we hypothesize that
              inorganic phosphate is both the primary feedback signal for
              stimulating oxidative phosphorylation in vivo and also the most
              significant product of ATP hydrolysis in limiting the capacity of
              the heart to hydrolyse ATP in vivo. Due to the lack of precise
              quantification of P(i) in vivo, these hypotheses and associated
              model predictions remain to be carefully tested experimentally.",

              Glucose and glutamine, in particular, are the primary carbon

              We identified tracer combinations that minimized confidence

              in vivo activities of intracellular enzymes and pathways,
              provides key information on biological systems in systems biology
              and metabolic engineering. It is based on a comprehensive
              approach combining (i) tracer cultivation on 13C substrates, (ii)
              13C labelling analysis by mass spectrometry and (iii)
              mathematical modelling for experimental design, data processing,
              flux calculation and statistics. Whereas the cultivation and the
              analytical part is fairly advanced, a lack of appropriate
              modelling software solutions for all modelling aspects in flux
              studies is limiting the application of metabolic flux
              analysis.RESULTS:We have developed OpenFLUX as a user friendly,
              yet flexible software application for small and large scale 13C
              metabolic flux analysis. The application is based on the new
              Elementary Metabolite Unit (EMU) framework, significantly
              enhancing computation speed for flux calculation. From simple
              notation of metabolic reaction networks defined in a spreadsheet,
              the OpenFLUX parser automatically generates MATLAB-readable
              metabolite and isotopomer balances, thus strongly facilitating
              model creation. The model can be used to perform experimental
              design, parameter estimation and sensitivity analysis either
              using the built-in gradient-based search or Monte Carlo
              algorithms or in user-defined algorithms. Exemplified for a
              microbial flux study with 71 reactions, 8 free flux parameters
              and mass isotopomer distribution of 10 metabolites, OpenFLUX
              allowed to automatically compile the EMU-based model from an
              Excel file containing metabolic reactions and carbon transfer
              mechanisms, showing it's user-friendliness. It reliably
              reproduced the published data and optimum flux distributions for
              the network under study were found quickly (<20
              sec).CONCLUSION:We have developed a fast, accurate application to
              perform steady-state 13C metabolic flux analysis. OpenFLUX will
              strongly facilitate and enhance the design, calculation and
              interpretation of metabolic flux studies. By providing the
              software open source, we hope it will evolve with the rapidly

              uses Monte-Carlo simulations to investigate the reliability of

              measured in brain amino acids such as glutamate and glutamine
              during 1-(13)C- or 1,6-(13)C(2)glucose infusion. Results show
              that the determination of V(NT) is not very precise under
              experimental conditions typical of in vivo NMR studies, whereas
              the neuronal TCA cycle rate V(TCA(N)) is determined with a much
              higher precision. Consistent with these results, simulated (13)C
              positional enrichment curves for glutamate and glutamine are much

              We analyse experimental data as well as models in two distinct
              cases: the relaxation-like oscillations seen in yeast extracts,
              and the sinusoidal Hopf oscillations seen in intact yeast cells.
              In the case of yeast extracts, we use flux-change plots and model
              analyses to establish that the oscillations are driven by on/off
              switching of phosphofructokinase. In the case of intact yeast
              cells, we find that the instability leading to the appearance of
              oscillations is caused by the stoichiometry of the ATP-ADP-AMP
              system and the allosteric regulation of phosphofructokinase,
              whereas frequency control is distributed over the reaction
              network. Notably, the NAD+/NADH ratio modulates the frequency of
              the oscillations without affecting the instability. This is
              important for understanding the mutual synchronization of
              oscillations in the individual yeast cells, as synchronization is
              believed to occur via acetaldehyde, which in turn affects the

  abstract = "Within the last decades NMR spectroscopy has undergone tremendous
              development and has become a powerful analytical tool for the
              investigation of intracellular flux distributions in biochemical
              networks using (13)C-labeled substrates. Not only are the
              experiments much easier to conduct than experiments employing
              radioactive tracer elements, but NMR spectroscopy also provides
              additional information on the labeling pattern of the
              metabolites. Whereas the maximum amount of information obtainable
              with (14)C-labeled substrates is the fractional enrichment in the
              individual carbon atom positions, NMR spectroscopy can also
              provide information on the degree of labeling at neighboring
              carbon atom positions by analyzing multiplet patterns in NMR
              spectra or using 2-dimensional NMR spectra. It is possible to
              quantify the mole fractions of molecules that show a specific
              labeling pattern, i.e., information of the isotopomer
              distribution in metabolite pools can be obtained. The isotopomer
              distribution is the maximum amount of information that in theory
              can be obtained from (13)C-tracer studies. The wealth of
              information contained in NMR spectra frequently leads to
              overdetermined algebraic systems. Consequently, fluxes must be
              estimated by nonlinear least squares analysis, in which
              experimental labeling data is compared with simulated steady
              state isotopomer distributions. Hence, mathematical models are
              required to compute the steady state isotopomer distribution as a
              function of a given set of steady state fluxes. Because 2(n)
              possible labeling patterns exist in a molecule of n carbon atoms,
              and each pattern corresponds to a separate state in the
              isotopomer model, these models are inherently complex. Model
              complexity, so far, has restricted usage of isotopomer
              information to relatively small metabolic networks. A general
              methodology for the formulation of isotopomer models is
              described. The model complexity of isotopomer models is reduced
              to that of classical metabolic models by expressing the 2(n)
              isotopomer mass balances of a metabolite pool in a single matrix
              equation. Using this approach an isotopomer model has been
              implemented that describes label distribution in primary carbon
              metabolism, i.e., in a metabolic network including the
              Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas and pentose phosphate pathway, the
              tricarboxylic acid cycle, and selected anaplerotic reaction
              sequences. The model calculates the steady state label

              allows one to quantify and understand the limitations imposed on
              the cell by its metabolic stoichiometry, and to understand how
              the flux through each pathway influences the overall behavior of
              metabolism. A stoichiometric matrix accounting for the major
              pathways involved in energy and mass transformations in the cell
              was used in our analysis. The auxiliary parameters of linear
              optimization, the so-called shadow prices, identify the
              intermediates and cofactors that cause the growth to be limited
              on each nutrient. This formalism was used to examine how well the
              cell balances its needs for carbon, nitrogen, and energy during
              growth on different substrates. The relative values of glucose
              and glutamine as nutrients were compared by varying the ratio of
              rates of glucose to glutamine uptakes, and calculating the
              maximum growth rate. The optimum value of this ratio is between
              2-7, similar to experimentally observed ratios. The theoretical

              that reaction. Some reactions, such as malic enzyme and glutamate

              that is seen both in rapidly proliferating mammalian cells and

              origin for its presence in these widely different systems is
              unknown. To study this issue, here we develop a model of human
              central metabolism that incorporates a solvent capacity
              constraint of metabolic enzymes and mitochondria, accounting for
              their occupied volume densities, while assuming glucose and/or
              fatty acid utilization. The model demonstrates that activation of
              aerobic glycolysis is favored above a threshold metabolic rate in
              both rapidly proliferating cells and heavily contracting muscles,
              because it provides higher ATP yield per volume density than
              mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. In the case of muscle
              physiology, the model also predicts that before the lactate
              switch, fatty acid oxidation increases, reaches a maximum, and
              then decreases to zero with concomitant increase in glucose
              utilization, in agreement with the empirical evidence. These
              results are further corroborated by a larger scale model,
              including biosynthesis of major cell biomass components. The
              larger scale model also predicts that in proliferating cells the
              lactate switch is accompanied by activation of glutaminolysis,
              another distinctive feature of the Warburg effect. In conclusion,
              intracellular molecular crowding is a fundamental constraint for
              cell metabolism in both rapidly proliferating- and
              non-proliferating cells with high metabolic demand. Addition of

               use of atom mapping matrices, which decouple the generation of
               the steady state equations from the details of the transfer of
               carbon atoms from reactants to products. The use of atom mapping
               matrices results in a clear, intuitive description of metabolic

  abstract = "Skeletal muscle plays a major role in the regulation of
              whole-body energy metabolism during physiological stresses such
              as ischemia, hypoxia, and exercise. Current experimental
              techniques provide relatively little in vivo data on dynamic
              responses of metabolite concentrations and metabolic fluxes in
              skeletal muscle to such physiological stimuli. As a complementary
              approach to experimental measurements and as a framework for
              quantitatively analyzing available in vivo data, a
              physiologically based model of skeletal muscle cellular
              metabolism and energetics is developed. This model, which
              incorporates key transport and reaction processes, is based on
              dynamic mass balances of 30 chemical species in capillary (blood)
              and tissue (cell) domains. The reaction fluxes in the cellular
              domain are expressed in terms of a generalized Michaelis?Menten
              equation involving energy controller ratios ATP/ADP and ATP/ADP
              and NADH/NAD+ . This formalism introduces a large number of
              unknown parameters ( approximately 90). Estimating these
              parameters from in vivo sparse data and evaluating dynamic
              sensitivities of the model outputs with respect to these
              parameters is a challenging problem. Parameter estimation is
              accomplished using an efficient, nonlinear, constraint-based,
              optimization algorithm that minimizes differences between
              available experimental data and corresponding model outputs by
              explicitly utilizing equality constraints on resting fluxes and
              concentrations. With the estimated parameter values, the model is
              able to simulate dynamic responses to reduced blood flow
              (ischemia) of key metabolite concentrations and metabolic fluxes,
              both measured and nonmeasured. A general parameter sensitivity
              analysis is carried out to determine and characterize the
              parameters having the most and least effects on the measured

              modeling studies performed in the brain to date have only modeled
              time courses of total isotopic enrichment at individual carbon
              positions (positional enrichments), not taking advantage of the
              additional dynamic (13)C isotopomer information available from
              fine-structure multiplets in (13)C spectra. Here we introduce a
              new (13)C metabolic modeling approach using the concept of bonded
              cumulative isotopomers, or bonded cumomers. The direct
              relationship between bonded cumomers and (13)C multiplets enables
              fitting of the dynamic multiplet data. The potential of this new
              approach is demonstrated using Monte-Carlo simulations with a
              brain two-compartment neuronal-glial model. The precision of
              positional and cumomer approaches are compared for two different
              metabolic models (with and without glutamine dilution) and for
              different infusion protocols ([1,6-(13)C(2)]glucose,

              labeling experiments (CLE) has become a major diagnostic tool in
              metabolic engineering. The mathematical centerpiece of MFA is the
              solution of isotopomer labeling systems (ILS). An ILS is a
              high-dimensional nonlinear differential equation system that
              describes the distribution of isotopomers over a metabolic
              network during a carbon labeling experiment. This contribution
              presents a global analysis of the dynamic behavior of general
              ILSs. It is proven that an ILS is globally stable under very weak
              conditions that are always satisfied in practice. In particular
              it is shown that in some sense ILSs are a nonlinear extension to
              the classical theory of compartmental systems. The central
              stability condition for compartmental systems, i.e., the
              non-existence of traps in linear compartmental networks, is also
              the major stability condition for ILSs. As an important side
              result of the proof, it is shown that ILSs can be transformed to
              a cascade of linear systems with time-dependent inhomogeneous
              terms. This cascade structure has considerable consequences for

              (13)C-(1)H correlation nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy

              flux analysis, does not require measurements of extracellular

              coli strains that moderately overexpress phosphofructokinase,
              pyruvate kinase, pyruvate decarboxylase, or alcohol dehydrogenase
              revealed that only a few flux ratios change in concert with the
              overexpression of these enzymes. Disruption of both pyruvate
              kinase isoenzymes resulted in altered flux ratios for reactions
              connecting the phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) and pyruvate pools but
              did not significantly alter central metabolism. These data
              indicate remarkable robustness and rigidity in central carbon
              metabolism in the presence of genetic variation. More significant
              physiological changes and flux ratio differences were seen in
              response to altered environmental conditions. For example, in
              ammonia-limited chemostat cultures, compared to glucose-limited
              chemostat cultures, a reduced fraction of PEP molecules was
              derived through at least one transketolase reaction, and there
              was a higher relative contribution of anaplerotic PEP
              carboxylation than of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle for
              oxaloacetate synthesis. These two parameters also showed
              significant variation between aerobic and anaerobic batch
              cultures. Finally, two reactions catalyzed by PEP carboxykinase
              and malic enzyme were identified by METAFoR analysis; these had
              previously been considered absent in E. coli cells grown in
              glucose-containing media. Backward flux from the TCA cycle to
              glycolysis, as indicated by significant activity of PEP
              carboxykinase, was found only in glucose-limited chemostat

              skeletal muscle that may become evident in response to
              physiological stresses such as reduction in blood flow and oxygen
              supply to mitochondria can be quantitatively understood using a
              multi-scale computational model. The analysis of dynamic
              responses from such a model can provide insights into mechanisms
              of metabolic regulation that may not be evident from experimental
              studies. For the purpose, a physiologically-based, multi-scale
              computational model of skeletal muscle cellular metabolism and
              energetics was developed to describe dynamic responses of key
              chemical species and reaction fluxes to muscle ischemia. The
              model, which incorporates key transport and metabolic processes
              and subcellular compartmentalization, is based on dynamic mass
              balances of 30 chemical species in both capillary blood and
              tissue cells (cytosol and mitochondria) domains. The reaction
              fluxes in cytosol and mitochondria are expressed in terms of a
              general phenomenological Michaelis-Menten equation involving the
              compartmentalized energy controller ratios ATP/ADP and
              NADH/NAD(+). The unknown transport and reaction parameters in the
              model are estimated simultaneously by minimizing the differences
              between available in vivo experimental data on muscle ischemia
              and corresponding model outputs in coupled with the resting
              linear flux balance constraints using a robust, nonlinear,
              constrained-based, reduced gradient optimization algorithm. With
              the optimal parameter values, the model is able to simulate
              dynamic responses to reduced blood flow and oxygen supply to
              mitochondria associated with muscle ischemia of several key
              metabolite concentrations and metabolic fluxes in the subcellular
              cytosolic and mitochondrial compartments, some that can be
              measured and others that can not be measured with the current
              experimental techniques. The model can be applied to test complex
              hypotheses involving dynamic regulation of cellular metabolism

  author   = "Dingel, Janis and Milenkovic, Olgica",
  abstract = "MOTIVATION: The problem of reverse engineering the dynamics of
              gene expression profiles is of focal importance in systems
              biology. Due to noise and the inherent lack of sufficiently large
              datasets generated via high-throughput measurements, known
              reconstruction frameworks based on dynamical systems models fail
              to provide adequate settings for network analysis. This motivates
              the study of new approaches that produce stochastic lists of
              explanations for the observed network dynamics that can be
              efficiently inferred from small sample sets and in the presence
              of errors. RESULTS: We introduce a novel algebraic modeling
              framework, termed stochastic polynomial dynamical systems (SPDSs)
              that can capture the dynamics of regulatory networks based on
              microarray expression data. Here, we refer to dynamics of the
              network as the trajectories of gene expression profiles over
              time. The model assumes that the expression data is quantized in
              a manner that allows for imposing a finite field structure on the
              observations, and the existence of polynomial update functions
              for each gene in the network. The underlying reverse engineering
              algorithm is based on ideas borrowed from coding theory, and in
              particular, list-decoding methods for so called Reed-Muller
              codes. The list-decoding method was tested on synthetic data and
              on microarray expression measurements from the M(3D) database,
              corresponding to a subnetwork of the Escherichia coli SOS repair
              system, as well as on the complete transcription factor network,
              available at RegulonDB. The results show that SPDSs constructed
              via list-decoders significantly outperform other algebraic
              reverse engineering methods, and that they also provide good
              guidelines for estimating the influence of genes on the dynamics
              of the network. AVAILABILITY: Software codes for list-decoding
              algorithms suitable for direct application to quantized
              expression data will be publicly available at the authors'

              this paper, we describe a predictive modeling approach for
              studying regulatory networks, based on a machine learning
              algorithm called MEDUSA. MEDUSA integrates promoter sequence,
              mRNA expression, and transcription factor occupancy data to learn
              gene regulatory programs that predict the differential expression
              of target genes. Instead of using clustering or correlation of
              expression profiles to infer regulatory relationships, MEDUSA
              determines condition-specific regulators and discovers regulatory
              motifs that mediate the regulation of target genes. In this way,
              MEDUSA meaningfully models biological mechanisms of
              transcriptional regulation. MEDUSA solves the problem of
              predicting the differential (up/down) expression of target genes
              by using boosting, a technique from statistical learning, which
              helps to avoid overfitting as the algorithm searches through the
              high-dimensional space of potential regulators and sequence
              motifs. Experimental results demonstrate that MEDUSA achieves
              high prediction accuracy on held-out experiments (test data),
              that is, data not seen in training. We also present
              context-specific analysis of MEDUSA regulatory programs for DNA

              regulators and motifs in these processes. A central challenge in
              the field is the difficulty of validating reverse-engineered
              networks in the absence of a gold standard. Our approach of
              learning regulatory programs provides at least a partial solution
              for the problem: MEDUSA's prediction accuracy on held-out data
              gives a concrete and statistically sound way to validate how well
              the algorithm performs. With MEDUSA, statistical validation
              becomes a prerequisite for hypothesis generation and network
              building rather than a secondary consideration.",

              metabolic flux of pyruvate to lactate, in a well-controlled
              injection/perfusion system using T47D human breast cancer cells.
              Initial rates of pyruvate-to-lactate conversion were obtained by
              fitting the hyperpolarized (13)C and ancillary (31)P NMR data to
              a model, yielding both kinetic parameters and mechanistic insight
              into this conversion. Transport was found to be the rate-limiting
              process for the conversion of extracellular pyruvate to lactate
              with K(m) = 2.14 +/- 0.03 mM, typical of the monocarboxylate

  abstract = "Kinetic modelling of complex metabolic networks - a central goal
              of computational systems biology - is currently hampered by the
              lack of reliable rate equations for the majority of the
              underlying biochemical reactions and membrane transporters. On
              the basis of biochemically substantiated evidence that metabolic
              control is exerted by a narrow set of key regulatory enzymes, we
              propose here a hybrid modelling approach in which only the
              central regulatory enzymes are described by detailed mechanistic
              rate equations, and the majority of enzymes are approximated by
              simplified(non mechanistic) rate equations (e.g. mass action,
              LinLog, Michaelis-Menten and power law) capturing only a few
              basic kinetic features and hence containing only a small number
              of parameters to be experimentally determined. To check the
              reliability of this approach, we have applied it to two different
              metabolic networks, the energy and redox metabolism of red blood
              cells, and the purine metabolism of hepatocytes, using in both
              cases available comprehensive mechanistic models as reference
              standards. Identification of the central regulatory enzymes was
              performed by employing only information on network topology and
              the metabolic data for a single reference state of the network

               reactions controlled by many genes. Changes in cellular

               We present a new approach to this problem, linking gene

  abstract = "Understanding cerebral energy metabolism in neurons and
              astrocytes is necessary for the interpretation of functional
              brain imaging data. It has been suggested that astrocytes can
              provide lactate as an energy fuel to neurons, a process referred
              to as astrocyte-neuron lactate shuttle (ANLS). Some authors
              challenged this hypothesis, defending the classical view that
              glucose is the major energy substrate of neurons, at rest as well
              as in response to a stimulation. To test the ANLS hypothesis from
              a theoretical point of view, we developed a mathematical model of
              compartmentalized energy metabolism between neurons and
              astrocytes, adopting hypotheses highly unfavorable to ANLS.
              Simulation results can be divided between two groups, depending
              on the relative neuron versus astrocyte stimulation. If this
              ratio is low, ANLS is observed during all the stimulus and
              poststimulus periods (continuous ANLS), but a high ratio induces
              ANLS only at the beginning of the stimulus and during the
              poststimulus period (triphasic behavior). Finally, our results
              show that current experimental data on lactate kinetics are
              compatible with the ANLS hypothesis, and that it is essential to
              assess the neuronal and astrocytic NADH/NAD+ ratio changes to
              test the ANLS hypothesis.",

              particular, the number of fully annotated metabolite entries has
              grown from 2180 to more than 6800 (a 300\% increase), while the

  abstract = "BACKGROUND:Metabolic flux analysis has become an established
              method in systems biology and functional genomics. The most
              common approach for determining intracellular metabolic fluxes is
              to utilize mass spectrometry in combination with stable isotope
              labeling experiments. However, before the mass spectrometric data
              can be used it has to be corrected for biases caused by naturally
              occurring stable isotopes, by the analytical technique(s)
              employed, or by the biological sample itself. Finally the MS data
              and the labeling information it contains have to be assembled
              into a data format usable by flux analysis software (of which
              several dedicated packages exist). Currently the processing of
              mass spectrometric data is time-consuming and error-prone
              requiring peak by peak cut-and-paste analysis and manual
              curation. In order to facilitate high-throughput metabolic flux
              analysis, the automation of multiple steps in the analytical
              workflow is necessary.RESULTS:Here we describe iMS2Flux, software
              developed to automate, standardize and connect the data flow
              between mass spectrometric measurements and flux analysis
              programs. This tool streamlines the transfer of data from
              extraction via correction tools to 13C-Flux software by
              processing MS data from stable isotope labeling experiments. It
              allows the correction of large and heterogeneous MS datasets for
              the presence of naturally occurring stable isotopes, initial
              biomass and several mass spectrometry effects. Before and after
              data correction, several checks can be performed to ensure
              accurate data. The corrected data may be returned in a variety of
              formats including those used by metabolic flux analysis software
              such as 13CFLUX, OpenFLUX and 13CFLUX2.CONCLUSION:iMS2Flux is a
              versatile, easy to use tool for the automated processing of mass
              spectrometric data containing isotope labeling information. It
              represents the core framework for a standardized workflow and
              data processing. Due to its flexibility it facilitates the
              inclusion of different experimental datasets and thus can
              contribute to the expansion of flux analysis applications.",

              simple and robust method for the estimation of intracellular

              measured extracellular rates is complemented with 13C constraints
              from metabolic flux ratio analysis. Fluxes in central carbon
              metabolism of exponentially growing Escherichia coli were
              estimated by 13C-constrained flux balancing from three different
              13C-labeled glucose experiments. The best resolution of the
              network was achieved using 13C constraints derived from

              glycolysis or mitochondrial respiration. Oncogene activation and
              hypoxia promote glycolysis and lactate secretion. The
              significance of these metabolic changes to ATP production remains
              however ill defined. Here, we integrate LC‐MS‐based isotope
              tracer studies with oxygen uptake measurements in a quantitative
              redox‐balanced metabolic flux model of mammalian cellular
              metabolism. We then apply this approach to assess the impact of
              Ras and Akt activation and hypoxia on energy metabolism. Both
              oncogene activation and hypoxia induce roughly a twofold increase
              in glycolytic flux. Ras activation and hypoxia also strongly
              decrease glucose oxidation. Oxidative phosphorylation, powered
              substantially by glutamine‐driven TCA turning, however, persists
              and accounts for the majority of ATP production. Consistent with
              this, in all cases, pharmacological inhibition of oxidative
              phosphorylation markedly reduces energy charge, and glutamine but
              not glucose removal markedly lowers oxygen uptake. Thus,
              glutamine‐driven oxidative phosphorylation is a major means of
              ATP production even in hypoxic cancer cells. Synopsis The impact
              of oncogene activation and hypoxia on energy metabolism is
              analyzed by integrating quantitative measurements into a
              redox‐balanced metabolic flux model. Glutamine‐driven oxidative
              phosphorylation is found to be a major ATP source even in
              oncogene‐expressing or hypoxic cells. The integration of oxygen
              uptake measurements and LC‐MS‐based isotope tracer analyses in a
              redox‐balanced metabolic flux model enabled quantitative
              determination of energy generation pathways in cultured cells.In
              transformed mammalian cells, even in hypoxia (1\% oxygen),
              oxidative phosphorylation produces the majority of ATP.The
              oncogene Ras simultaneously increases glycolysis and decreases
              oxidative phosphorylation, thus resulting in no net increase in
              ATP production.Glutamine is the major source of high‐energy
              electrons for oxidative phosphorylation, especially upon Ras
              activation.cancer bioenergeticsisotope tracingmetabolic flux

              extensively to investigate alterations in cellular metabolism.
              The accuracy of these models to represent cellular metabolism in
              specific conditions has been improved by constraining the model
              with omics data sources. However, few practical methods for
              integrating metabolomics data with other omics data sources into
              genome-scale models of metabolism have been developed.Results:
              GIM3E (Gene Inactivation Moderated by Metabolism, Metabolomics
              and Expression) is an algorithm that enables the development of
              condition-specific models based on an objective function,
              transcriptomics and cellular metabolomics data. GIM3E establishes
              metabolite use requirements with metabolomics data, uses
              model-paired transcriptomics data to find experimentally
              supported solutions and provides calculations of the turnover
              (production/consumption) flux of metabolites. GIM3E was used to
              investigate the effects of integrating additional omics datasets
              to create increasingly constrained solution spaces of Salmonella
              Typhimurium metabolism during growth in both rich and virulence
              media. This integration proved to be informative and resulted in
              a requirement of additional active reactions (12 in each case) or
              metabolites (26 or 29, respectively). The addition of constraints
              from transcriptomics also impacted the allowed solution space,
              and the cellular metabolites with turnover fluxes that were
              necessarily altered by the change in conditions increased from

              in silico the metabolic networks of entire organisms. Work on
              bacteria is well advanced, and is now under way for plants and
              other eukaryotes. Genome-scale modelling in plants is much more
              challenging than in bacteria. The challenges come from features
              characteristic of higher organisms (subcellular compartmentation,
              tissue differentiation) and also from the particular severity in
              plants of a general problem: genome content whose functions
              remain undiscovered. This problem results in thousands of genes
              for which no function is known ('undiscovered genome content')
              and hundreds of enzymatic and transport functions for which no
              gene is yet identified. The severity of the undiscovered genome
              content problem in plants reflects their genome size and
              complexity. To bring the challenges of plant genome-scale
              modelling into focus, we first summarize the current status of
              plant genome-scale models. We then highlight the challenges - and
              ways to address them - in three areas: identifying genes for
              missing processes, modelling tissues as opposed to single cells,
              and finding metabolic functions encoded by undiscovered genome
              content. We also discuss the emerging view that a significant

              High-throughput annotation and metabolic modeling of these
              genomes is now a reality. The high-throughput reconstruction and
              analysis of genome-scale transcriptional regulatory networks
              represent the next frontier in microbial bioinformatics. The
              fruition of this next frontier will depend on the integration of
              numerous data sources relating to mechanisms, components and
              behavior of the transcriptional regulatory machinery, as well as
              the integration of the regulatory machinery into genome-scale
              cellular models. Here, we review existing repositories for
              different types of transcriptional regulatory data, including
              expression data, transcription factor data and binding site
              locations and we explore how these data are being used for the

              reconstructed and integrated with metabolic models to improve

              because high concentration of free intracellular iron is
              cytotoxic, cells have developed complex regulatory networks that

              reconstruction of genome-scale networks for a number of key
              organisms. The application of physicochemical constraints to
              these stoichiometric networks allows researchers, through methods
              such as flux balance analysis, to highlight key sets of reactions
              necessary to achieve particular objectives. The key benefits of
              constraint-based analysis lie in the minimal knowledge required
              to infer systemic properties. However, network degeneracy leads
              to a large number of flux distributions that satisfy any
              objective; moreover, these distributions may be dominated by
              biologically irrelevant internal cycles. By examining the
              geometry underlying the problem, we define two methods for
              finding a unique solution within the space of all possible flux
              distributions; such a solution contains no internal cycles, and
              is representative of the space as a whole. The first method draws
              on typical geometric knowledge, but cannot be applied to large
              networks because of the high computational complexity of the
              problem. Thus a second method, an iteration of linear programs
              which scales easily to the genome scale, is defined. The
              algorithm is run on four recent genome-scale models, and unique
              flux solutions are found. The algorithm set out here will allow
              researchers in flux balance analysis to exchange typical

  abstract = "MOTIVATION: Flux variability analysis (FVA) is an important tool
              to further analyse the results obtained by flux balance analysis
              (FBA) on genome-scale metabolic networks. For many
              constraint-based models, FVA identifies unboundedness of the
              optimal flux space. This reveals that optimal flux solutions with
              net flux through internal biochemical loops are feasible, which
              violates the second law of thermodynamics. Such unbounded fluxes
              may be eliminated by extending FVA with thermodynamic
              constraints. RESULTS: We present a new algorithm for efficient
              flux variability (and flux balance) analysis with thermodynamic
              constraints, suitable for analysing genome-scale metabolic
              networks. We first show that FBA with thermodynamic constraints
              is NP-hard. Then we derive a theoretical tractability result,
              which can be applied to metabolic networks in practice. We use
              this result to develop a new constraint programming algorithm
              Fast-tFVA for fast FVA with thermodynamic constraints (tFVA).
              Computational comparisons with previous methods demonstrate the
              efficiency of the new method. For tFVA, a speed-up of factor
              30-300 is achieved. In an analysis of genome-scale metabolic
              networks in the BioModels database, we found that in 485 of 716
              networks, additional irreversible or fixed reactions could be
              detected.Availability and implementation: Fast-tFVA is written in
              C++ and published under GPL. It uses the open source software
              SCIP and libSBML. There also exists a Matlab interface for easy

  abstract = "BACKGROUND:Quantitative knowledge of intracellular fluxes is
              important for a comprehensive characterization of metabolic
              networks and their functional operation. In contrast to direct
              assessment of metabolite concentrations, in vivo metabolite
              fluxes must be inferred indirectly from measurable quantities in
              13C experiments. The required experience, the complicated network
              models, large and heterogeneous data sets, and the time-consuming
              set-up of highly controlled experimental conditions largely
              restricted metabolic flux analysis to few expert groups. A
              conceptual simplification of flux analysis is the analytical
              determination of metabolic flux ratios exclusively from MS data,
              which can then be used in a second step to estimate absolute in
              vivo fluxes.RESULTS:Here we describe the user-friendly software
              package FiatFlux that supports flux analysis for non-expert
              users. In the first module, ratios of converging fluxes are
              automatically calculated from GC-MS-detected 13C-pattern in
              protein-bound amino acids. Predefined fragmentation patterns are
              automatically identified and appropriate statistical data
              treatment is based on the comparison of redundant information in
              the MS spectra. In the second module, absolute intracellular
              fluxes may be calculated by a 13C-constrained flux balancing
              procedure that combines experimentally determined fluxes in and
              out of the cell and the above flux ratios. The software is
              preconfigured to derive flux ratios and absolute in vivo fluxes
              from [1-13C] and [U-13C]glucose experiments and GC-MS analysis of
              amino acids for a variety of microorganisms.CONCLUSION:FiatFlux
              is an intuitive tool for quantitative investigations of
              intracellular metabolism by users that are not familiar with
              numerical methods or isotopic tracer experiments. The aim of this
              open source software is to enable non-specialists to adapt the
              software to their specific scientific interests, including other
              13C-substrates, labeling mixtures, and organisms.",

              this more sophisticated model allows an evaluation of 13C
              fractional enrichment of molecules entering both the oxidative
              and anaplerotic pathways under steady-state conditions. The
              method was used to analyze 13C NMR spectra of intact hearts or
              their acid extracts during utilization of 13C-enriched pyruvate,
              propionate, acetate, or various combinations thereof.

              pyruvate through pyruvate carboxylase is significant during
              co-perfusion of pyruvate and acetate, and we demonstrate for the
              first time that a nine-line 13C multiplet may be detected in an
              intact, beating heart. Acetate or pyruvate alone provided about
              86\% of the acetyl-CoA; in combination, about 65\% of the

              reduced the contribution of exogenous acetate to acetyl-CoA to
              77\% and also reduced the oxidation of endogenous substrates.
              Equations are presented which allow this same analysis on

               framework has been widely used to study steady-state flux
               solutions in genome-scale metabolic networks. One shortcoming of
               current COBRA methods is the possible violation of the loop law
               in the computed steady-state flux solutions. The loop law is
               analogous to Kirchhoff's second law for electric circuits, and
               states that at steady state there can be no net flux around a
               closed network cycle. Although the consequences of the loop law
               have been known for years, it has been computationally difficult
               to work with. Therefore, the resulting loop-law constraints have
               been overlooked. Here, we present a general mixed integer

  abstract = "Metabolic flux analysis (MFA) has emerged as a tool of great
              significance for metabolic engineering and mammalian physiology.
              An important limitation of MFA, as carried out via stable isotope
              labeling and GC/MS and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
              measurements, is the large number of isotopomer or cumomer
              equations that need to be solved, especially when multiple
              isotopic tracers are used for the labeling of the system. This
              restriction reduces the ability of MFA to fully utilize the power
              of multiple isotopic tracers in elucidating the physiology of
              realistic situations comprising complex bioreaction networks.
              Here, we present a novel framework for the modeling of isotopic
              labeling systems that significantly reduces the number of system
              variables without any loss of information. The elementary
              metabolite unit (EMU) framework is based on a highly efficient
              decomposition method that identifies the minimum amount of
              information needed to simulate isotopic labeling within a
              reaction network using the knowledge of atomic transitions
              occurring in the network reactions. The functional units
              generated by the decomposition algorithm, called EMUs, form the
              new basis for generating system equations that describe the
              relationship between fluxes and stable isotope measurements.
              Isotopomer abundances simulated using the EMU framework are
              identical to those obtained using the isotopomer and cumomer
              methods, however, require significantly less computation time.
              For a typical (13)C-labeling system the total number of equations
              that needs to be solved is reduced by one order-of-magnitude
              (100s EMUs vs. 1000s isotopomers). As such, the EMU framework is
              most efficient for the analysis of labeling by multiple isotopic
              tracers. For example, analysis of the gluconeogenesis pathway
              with (2)H, (13)C, and (18)O tracers requires only 354 EMUs,
              compared to more than two million isotopomers.",

  abstract = "Epistasis refers to the phenomenon in which phenotypic
              consequences caused by mutation of one gene depend on one or more
              mutations at another gene. Epistasis is critical for
              understanding many genetic and evolutionary processes, including
              pathway organization, evolution of sexual reproduction,
              mutational load, ploidy, genomic complexity, speciation, and the
              origin of life. Nevertheless, current understandings for the
              genome-wide distribution of epistasis are mostly inferred from
              interactions among one mutant type per gene, whereas how
              epistatic interaction partners change dynamically for different
              mutant alleles of the same gene is largely unknown. Here we
              address this issue by combining predictions from flux balance
              analysis and data from a recently published high-throughput
              experiment. Our results show that different alleles can
              epistatically interact with very different gene sets.
              Furthermore, between two random mutant alleles of the same gene,
              the chance for the allele with more severe mutational consequence
              to develop a higher percentage of negative epistasis than the
              other allele is 50∼70\% in eukaryotic organisms, but only 20∼30\%
              in bacteria and archaea. We developed a population genetics model
              that predicts that the observed distribution for the sign of
              epistasis can speed up the process of purging deleterious
              mutations in eukaryotic organisms. Our results indicate that
              epistasis among genes can be dynamically rewired at the genome
              level, and call on future efforts to revisit theories that can
              integrate epistatic dynamics among genes in biological systems.",

              serious drawback of the flux estimation method in current use is
              that it does not produce confidence limits for the estimated

              measure 2D [(13)C,(1)H] COSY NMR spectra of components of biomass
              grown on uniformly (13)C-labeled carbon sources. When using the
              entire set of measured data to simultaneously determine all
              fluxes in a proposed metabolic network model, the (13)C-labeling
              distribution in all measured compounds has to be simulated. This
              requires very large sets of isotopomer or cumomer balances. This
              article introduces the new concept of bondomers; entities that
              only vary in the numbers and positions of C-C bonds that have
              remained intact since the medium substrate molecule entered the
              metabolism. Bondomers are shown to have many analogies to
              isotopomers. One of these is that bondomers can be transformed to
              cumulative bondomers, just like isotopomers can be transformed to
              cumomers. Similarly to cumomers, cumulative bondomers allow an
              analytical solution of the entire set of balances describing a
              metabolic network. The main difference is that cumulative
              bondomer models are considerably smaller than corresponding

               brain parenchyma during a 360-secs activation. Glycolytic and
               oxidative cellular metabolism were homogeneously modeled between
               neurons and astrocytes, and the stimulation-induced neuronal
               versus astrocytic Na(+) inflow was set to 3:1. These assumptions
               resemble physiologic conditions and are supported by current
               literature. Simulations showed that glucose diffusion to the
               interstitium through basal lamina dominates the provision of the
               sugar to both neurons and astrocytes, whereas astrocytic endfeet
               transfer less than 4\% of the total glucose supplied to the
               tissue. Neuronal access to paracellularly diffused glucose
               prevails even after halving (doubling) the ratio of neuronal
               versus astrocytic glycolytic (oxidative) metabolism, as well as
               after reducing the neuronal versus astrocytic Na(+) inflow to a
               nonphysiologic value of 1:1. Noticeably, displaced glucose
               equivalents as intercellularly shuttled lactate account for
               approximately 6\% to 7\% of total brain glucose uptake, an
               amount comparable with the concomitant drainage of the

              a {"}module{"} in which reactions are linked by mass transfer.
              Although in principle all of these cellular modules are
              ultimately linked by mass transfer, in practice they can often be
              regarded as {"}isolated{"} from each other in terms of mass
              transfer. Here modules can interact with each other only by means
              of regulatory or catalytic effects-a chemical species in one
              module may affect the rate of a reaction in another module by
              binding to an enzyme or transport system or by acting as a
              catalyst. This paper seeks to answer two questions about the
              control and regulation of such multi-level reaction networks: (i)
              How can the control properties of the system as a whole be
              expressed in terms of the control properties of individual
              modules and the effects between modules? (ii) How do the control
              properties of a module in its isolated state change when it is
              embedded in the whole system through its connections with the
              other modules? In order to answer these questions a quantitative
              theoretical framework is developed and applied to systems
              containing two, three or four fully interacting modules; it is
              shown how it can be extended in principle to n modules. This
              newly developed theory therefore makes it possible to
              quantitatively dissect intermodular, internal and external
              regulation in multi-level systems.",

              experimental methods for metabolic flux determination by
              carbon-labeling experiments. A significant enlargement of the
              available measurement data set has been achieved, especially when
              isotopomer fractions within intracellular metabolite pools are
              quantitated. This information can be used to improve the
              statistical quality of flux estimates. Furthermore, several
              assumptions on bidirectional intracellular reaction steps that
              were hitherto indispensable may now become obsolete. To make full
              use of the complete measurement information a general
              mathematical model for isotopomer systems is established in this
              contribution. Then, by introducing the important new concept of
              cumomers and cumomer fractions, it is shown that the arising
              nonlinear isotopomer balance equations can be solved analytically
              in all cases. In particular, the solution of the metabolite flux
              balances and the positional carbon-labeling balances presented in
              part I of this series turn out to be just the first two steps of
              the general solution procedure for isotopomer balances. A
              detailed analysis of the isotopomer network structure then opens
              up new insights into the intrinsic structure of isotopomer
              systems. In particular, it turns out that isotopomer systems are
              not as complex as they appear at first glance. This enables some
              far-reaching conclusions to be drawn on the information potential
              of isotopomer experiments with respect to flux identification.
              Finally, some illustrative examples are examined to show that an
              information increase is not guaranteed when isotopomer
              measurements are used in addition to positional enrichment data.",

              experiments, as described by Marx et al. (Biotechnol. Bioeng. 49:
              11-29), results in a much more detailed stationary metabolic flux
              analysis. As opposed to basic metabolite flux balancing alone,
              this method enables both flux directions of bidirectional
              reaction steps to be quantitated. However, the mathematical
              treatment of carbon labeling systems is much more complicated,
              because it requires the solution of numerous balance equations
              that are bilinear with respect to fluxes and fractional labeling.
              In this study, a universal modeling framework is presented for
              describing the metabolite and carbon atom flux in a metabolic
              network. Bidirectional reaction steps are extensively treated and
              their impact on the system's labeling state is investigated.
              Various kinds of modeling assumptions, as usually made for
              metabolic fluxes, are expressed by linear constraint equations. A
              numerical algorithm for the solution of the resulting linear
              constrained set of nonlinear equations is developed. The
              numerical stability problems caused by large bidirectional fluxes
              are solved by a specially developed transformation method.
              Finally, the simulation of carbon labeling experiments is
              facilitated by a flexible software tool for network synthesis. An

  abstract = "An important goal of whole-cell computational modeling is to
              integrate detailed biochemical information with biological
              intuition to produce testable predictions. Based on the premise
              that prokaryotes such as Escherichia coli have maximized their
              growth performance along evolution, flux balance analysis (FBA)
              predicts metabolic flux distributions at steady state by using
              linear programming. Corroborating earlier results, we show that
              recent intracellular flux data for wild-type E. coli JM101
              display excellent agreement with FBA predictions. Although the
              assumption of optimality for a wild-type bacterium is
              justifiable, the same argument may not be valid for genetically
              engineered knockouts or other bacterial strains that were not
              exposed to long-term evolutionary pressure. We address this point
              by introducing the method of minimization of metabolic adjustment
              (MOMA), whereby we test the hypothesis that knockout metabolic
              fluxes undergo a minimal redistribution with respect to the flux
              configuration of the wild type. MOMA employs quadratic
              programming to identify a point in flux space, which is closest
              to the wild-type point, compatibly with the gene deletion
              constraint. Comparing MOMA and FBA predictions to experimental
              flux data for E. coli pyruvate kinase mutant PB25, we find that
              MOMA displays a significantly higher correlation than FBA. Our
              method is further supported by experimental data for E. coli
              knockout growth rates. It can therefore be used for predicting
              the behavior of perturbed metabolic networks, whose growth
              performance is in general suboptimal. MOMA and its possible
              future extensions may be useful in understanding the evolutionary

              metabolism is presented. Mechanisms such as glutamate cycling
              between neurons and astrocytes and glycogen storage in astrocytes
              have been implemented. A unique feature of the model is its
              calibration using in vivo data of brain glucose and lactate from
              freely moving rats under various stimuli. The model has been used
              to perform simulated perturbation experiments that show that
              glycogen breakdown in astrocytes is significantly activated
              during sensory (tail pinch) stimulation. This mechanism provides
              an additional input of energy substrate during high consumption
              phases. By way of validation, data from the perfusion of 50
              microM propranolol in the rat brain was compared with the model
              outputs. Propranolol affects the glucose dynamics during
              stimulation, and this was accurately reproduced in the model by a
              reduction in the glycogen breakdown in astrocytes. The model's
              predictive capacity was verified by using data from a sensory
              stimulation (restraint) that was not used for model calibration.
              Finally, a sensitivity analysis was conducted on the model
              parameters, this showed that the control of energy metabolism and
              transport processes are critical in the metabolic behaviour of

  title    = "An energy systems approach to Parkinson's disease",
  author   = "Wellstead, Peter and Cloutier, Mathieu",
  abstract = "The cause of Parkinson's disease (PD) remains unknown despite it
              being the second most prevalent neurodegenerative condition.
              Indeed, there is a growing consensus that there is no single
              cause, and that PD is a multifactorial systemic condition, in
              which a number of factors may determine its etiopathogenesis. We
              describe a systems approach that addresses the multifactorial
              aspects of PD and overcomes constraints on conventional
              experimentation imposed by PD's causal complexity, its long
              temporal duration, and its uniqueness to human brains.
              Specifically, a mathematical model of brain energy metabolism is
              used as a core module to which other modules describing cellular
              processes thought to be associated with PD can be attached and
              studied in an integrative environment. Employing brain energy
              usage as the core of a systems approach also enables the
              potential role that compromised energy metabolism may have in the
              etiology of PD. Although developed for PD, it has not escaped our
              attention that the energy systems approach outlined here could
              also be applied to other neurodegenerative disorders-most notably
              Alzheimer's disease.",

              currently faced by computational biology. Constraint-based models
              in particular play a key role in the attempt to obtain a
              quantitative understanding of cellular metabolism at genome
              scale. In essence, their goal is to frame the metabolic
              capabilities of an organism based on minimal assumptions that
              describe the steady states of the underlying reaction network via
              suitable stoichiometric constraints, specifically mass balance
              and energy balance (i.e. thermodynamic feasibility). The
              implementation of these requirements to generate viable
              configurations of reaction fluxes and/or to test given flux
              profiles for thermodynamic feasibility can however prove to be
              computationally intensive. We propose here a fast and scalable
              stoichiometry-based method to explore the Gibbs energy landscape
              of a biochemical network at steady state. The method is applied
              to the problem of reconstructing the Gibbs energy landscape
              underlying metabolic activity in the human red blood cell, and to
              that of identifying and removing thermodynamically infeasible
              reaction cycles in the Escherichia coli metabolic network
              (iAF1260). In the former case, we produce consistent predictions
              for chemical potentials (or log-concentrations) of intracellular
              metabolites; in the latter, we identify a restricted set of loops

              dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD), prevented NTP hydrolysis and

              31P-NMR and laser microspectrofluorimetry. Time dependence of pHi

              Microspectrofluorimetry, after loading of the cells with SNARF-1,
              enabled the determination of pHi in isolated cells and its
              distribution among the cell population. By this method, the
              vacuolar pH could not be distinguished from the cytoplasmic pH in
              C. albicans blastospores, but alkalization of pHi was observed at
              the beginning of germ tubes. The absolute values of pHi
              determined by 31P-NMR were slightly different from those obtained
              by laser microspectrofluorimetry. However, the pH distributions

              increased copy number of some glycolytic genes could have
              conferred an almost immediate selective advantage to an ancestor
              of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, providing a rationale for the
              success of the WGD. We propose that the loss of other redundant

              increase gave post-WGD yeasts a growth advantage through rapid

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: The unique metabolism of tumors was described many
              years ago by Otto Warburg, who identified tumor cells with
              increased glycolysis and decreased mitochondrial activity.
              However, {"}aerobic glycolysis{"} generates fewer ATP per glucose
              molecule than mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, so in
              terms of energy production, it is unclear how increasing a less
              efficient process provides tumors with a growth advantage.
              METHODS/FINDINGS: We carried out a screen for loss of genetic
              elements in pancreatic tumor cells that accelerated their growth
              as tumors, and identified mitochondrial ribosomal protein L28
              (MRPL28). Knockdown of MRPL28 in these cells decreased
              mitochondrial activity, and increased glycolysis, but
              paradoxically, decreased cellular growth in vitro. Following
              Warburg's observations, this mutation causes decreased
              mitochondrial function, compensatory increase in glycolysis and
              accelerated growth in vivo. Likewise, knockdown of either
              mitochondrial ribosomal protein L12 (MRPL12) or cytochrome
              oxidase had a similar effect. Conversely, expression of the
              mitochondrial uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) increased oxygen
              consumption and decreased tumor growth. Finally, treatment of
              tumor bearing animals with dichloroacetate (DCA) increased
              pyruvate consumption in the mitochondria, increased total oxygen
              consumption, increased tumor hypoxia and slowed tumor growth.
              CONCLUSIONS: We interpret these findings to show that
              non-oncogenic genetic changes that alter mitochondrial metabolism
              can regulate tumor growth through modulation of the consumption
              of oxygen, which appears to be a rate limiting substrate for

              and adaptation has been of intense interest, but experimental
              evidence has been limited. The genetic switch controlling the
              yeast galactose use pathway includes two paralogous genes in
              Saccharomyces cerevisiae that encode a co-inducer (GAL3) and a
              galactokinase (GAL1). These paralogues arose from a single
              bifunctional ancestral gene as is still present in Kluyveromyces

              cooperative behaviors, in the context of energetic metabolism.
              Glycolysis can perform either under a dissipative working regime
              suitable for rapid proliferation or under an efficient regime
              that entails a good modus operandi under conditions of glucose
              shortage. A cellular mechanism allowing switching between these
              two regimes may represent an evolutionary achievement. Thus, we
              have explored the conditions that might have favored the
              emergence of such an accommodative mechanism. Because of an
              inevitable conflict for resources between individual interests
              and the common good, rapid and inefficient use of glucose is
              always favored by natural selection in spatially homogeneous
              environment, regardless of the external conditions. In contrast,
              when the space is structured, the behavior of the system is
              determined by its free energy content. If the fuel is abundant,
              the dissipative strategy dominates the space. However, under
              famine conditions the efficient regime represents an evolutionary
              stable strategy in a Harmony game. Between these two extreme
              situations, both metabolic regimes are engaged in a Prisoner's
              Dilemma game, where the output depends on the extracellular free
              energy. The energy transition values that lead from one domain to
              another have been calculated. We conclude that an accommodative
              mechanism permitting alternation between dissipative and
              efficient regimes might have evolved in heterogeneous and highly
              fluctuating environments. Overall, the current work shows how

              transition into mitosis abrupt and decisive. To generate a
              bistable response, some component of a double-negative feedback
              loop must exhibit an ultrasensitive response to its upstream

              effects, multisite phosphorylation, and competition mechanisms.
              We found that the ultrasensitivity in the inactivation of Wee1
              arises mainly through two competition mechanisms: competition
              between two sets of phosphorylation sites in Wee1 and between
              Wee1 and other high-affinity Cdk1 targets. Based on these
              findings, we were able to reconstitute a highly ultrasensitive

              biochemical oscillator that controls the periodic activation and
              inactivation of cyclin B1-CDK1. The oscillator circuit includes a
              system of three interlinked positive and double-negative feedback
              loops (CDK1 -> Cdc25 -> CDK1; CDK1 -/ Wee1 -/ CDK1; and CDK1 -/
              Myt1 -/ CDK1) that collectively function as a bistable trigger.
              Previous work established that this bistable trigger is essential
              for CDK1 oscillations in the early embryonic cell cycle. Here, we
              assess the importance of the trigger in the somatic cell cycle,
              where checkpoints and additional regulatory mechanisms could
              render it dispensable. Our approach was to express the
              phosphorylation site mutant CDK1AF, which short-circuits the
              feedback loops, in HeLa cells, and to monitor cell cycle
              progression by live cell fluorescence microscopy. We found that
              CDK1AF-expressing cells carry out a relatively normal first
              mitosis, but then undergo rapid cycles of cyclin B1 accumulation
              and destruction at intervals of 3-6 h. During these cycles, the
              cells enter and exit M phase-like states without carrying out
              cytokinesis or karyokinesis. Phenotypically similar rapid cycles
              were seen in Wee1 knockdown cells. These findings show that the
              interplay between CDK1, Wee1/Myt1, and Cdc25 is required for the
              establishment of G1 phase, for the normal approximately 20-h cell
              cycle period, and for the switch-like oscillations in cyclin B1
              abundance characteristic of the somatic cell cycle. We propose
              that the HeLa cell cycle is built upon an unreliable negative
              feedback oscillator and that the normal high reliability, slow
              pace and switch-like character of the cycle is imposed by a

              We analyse experimental data as well as models in two distinct
              cases: the relaxation-like oscillations seen in yeast extracts,
              and the sinusoidal Hopf oscillations seen in intact yeast cells.
              In the case of yeast extracts, we use flux-change plots and model
              analyses to establish that the oscillations are driven by on/off
              switching of phosphofructokinase. In the case of intact yeast
              cells, we find that the instability leading to the appearance of
              oscillations is caused by the stoichiometry of the ATP-ADP-AMP
              system and the allosteric regulation of phosphofructokinase,
              whereas frequency control is distributed over the reaction
              network. Notably, the NAD+/NADH ratio modulates the frequency of
              the oscillations without affecting the instability. This is
              important for understanding the mutual synchronization of
              oscillations in the individual yeast cells, as synchronization is

              acid pools during autonomous oscillations of Saccharomyces
              cerevisiae were quantified in glucose-limited continuous
              cultivations. At a dilution rate of D = 0.22 h(-1) cyclic changes
              with a period of 120 min were found for many variables such as
              carbon dioxide production rate, dissolved oxygen, pH, biomass
              content, and various metabolite concentrations. On the basis of
              the observed dynamic patterns, free intracellular amino acids
              were classified to show oscillatory, stationary, or chaotic
              behavior. Amino acid pools such as serine, alanine, valine,
              leucine, or lysine were subjected to clear oscillations with a
              frequency of 120 min, identical to that of other described
              cultivation variables, indicating that there is a direct
              correlation between the periodic changes of amino acid
              concentrations and the metabolic oscillations on the cellular
              level. The oscillations of these amino acids were unequally
              phase-delayed and had different amplitudes of oscillation.
              Accordingly, they exhibited different patterns in phase plane
              plots vs. intracellular trehalose. Despite the complex and marked
              metabolic changes during oscillation, selected intracellular
              amino acids such as histidine, threonine, isoleucine, or arginine
              remained about constant. Concentrations of glutamate and
              glutamine showed a chaotic behavior. However, the ratio of
              glutamate to glutamine concentration was found to be oscillatory,
              with a period of 60 min and a corresponding figure eight-shaped
              pattern in a plot vs. trehalose concentration. Considering the

              to that of catabolism. On the transition to the respiratory
              phase, cAMP levels increased triggering the breakdown of storage

              glycolytic pathway activated production of glycerol and ethanol
              consuming NADH. The resulting increase in the NAD(+)/NADH ratio

              oscillations in carbon dioxide production rate, intracellular
              concentrations of trehalose and various free amino acids, and
              extracellular acetate and pyruvate in the same culture. Of the
              glycolytic intermediates, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, 2- and
              3-phosphoglycerate, and phosphoenolpyruvate show the most
              pronounced oscillatory behavior, the latter three compounds
              oscillating out of phase with the former. This agrees with
              previously observed metabolic control by phosphofructokinase and
              pyruvate kinase. Although individually not clearly oscillating,
              several intermediates of the TCA cycle, i.e.,
              alpha-ketoglutarate, succinate, fumarate, and malate, exhibited
              increasing concentration during the cell cycle phase with high
              carbon flux through glycolysis and TCA cycle. The average mass

              Together with the observed close correlation of the pool sizes of
              the involved metabolites, this might indicate that, in vivo,
              these reactions are operating close to equilibrium, whereby care
              must be taken due to possible differences between in vivo and in
              vitro conditions. Combining the data with previously determined
              intracellular amino acid levels from the same culture, a few
              clear correlations between catabolism and anabolism could be
              identified: phosphoglycerate/serine and
              alpha-ketoglutarate/lysine exhibited correlated oscillatory
              behavior, albeit with different phase shifts. Oscillations in

              abundance profiles to predict transcriptional regulatory
              interactions. The ultimate goal is to develop causal network
              models describing the transcriptional influences that genes exert
              on each other (via their protein products), which can be used to
              predict network disruptions (e.g., mutations) leading to a
              disease phenotype, as well as the appropriate therapeutic
              intervention. However, microarray data measure only a small
              component of the interacting variables in a genetic regulatory
              network, as cells are known to regulate gene expression via many
              diverse mechanisms. Although many researchers have acknowledged
              the questionable interpretation of statistical dependencies

              relied heavily upon the genetics of yeast, worms, flies, mice,
              and humans. The use of second site suppressors and epistasis has
              permitted the detection of interacting elements and the sequence

              elucidate metabolic pathways, demonstrate protein complexes, and
              identify functions of gene products. The tools of molecular
              biology-knocking concentration of protein products down or

              reverse-engineering biological networks to better understand
              cellular functions. The experimental methods in determining
              protein-protein interactions are time-consuming and costly, which
              has motivated vigorous development of computational approaches
              for predicting protein-protein interactions. A set of recently
              developed bioinformatics methods utilizes coevolutionary
              information of the interacting partners (e.g., as exhibited in
              the form of correlations between distance matrices, where, for
              each protein, a matrix stores the pairwise distances between the
              protein and its orthologs in a group of reference genomes). We
              proposed a novel method to account for the intra-matrix
              correlations in improving predictive accuracy. The distance
              matrices for a pair of proteins are transformed and concatenated
              into a phylogenetic vector. A least-squares support vector
              machine is trained and tested on pairs of proteins, represented
              as phylogenetic vectors, whose interactions are known. The
              intra-matrix correlations are accounted for by introducing a
              weighted linear kernel, which determines the dot product of two
              phylogenetic vectors. The performance, measured as receiver
              operator characteristic (ROC) score in cross-validation
              experiments, shows significant improvement of our method (ROC

              algebra to the modeling of signaling networks, based on
              time-course protein modification data. Computational algebraic
              techniques are employed to construct next-state functions. A
              Monte Carlo method is used to approximate the Deegan-Packel Index

              Deegan-Packel Index of Power is used to conjecture dependencies

              time-consuming, approaches allowing researchers to discriminate
              alternative hypotheses with a minimal set of experiments are
              highly desirable. Given a null hypothesis and alternative model,
              as well as laboratory constraints like observable players, sample
              size, noise level, and stimulation options, we suggest a method
              to obtain a list of required experiments in order to
              significantly reject the null hypothesis model M0 if a specified
              alternative model MA is realized. For this purpose, we estimate
              the power to detect a violation of M0 by means of Monte Carlo
              simulations. Iteratively, the power is maximized over all
              feasible stimulations of the system using multi-experiment

              method can validate the signaling networks with conditional
              perturbation data extracted from published experiments, and can
              suggest additional tests to improve the network. It searches the
              alternative pathway space between all pairs of nodes, constructs
              pathnets (set of pathways between two nodes) and validates the
              network edges using conditional perturbation. For pathnets
              without conditional data, experiments with the fewest number of

              the reconstructed network is consistent with the consensus model.

  abstract  = " Author Summary The fact that functionally more important genes
               or DNA sequences evolve more slowly than less important ones is
               commonly believed and frequently used by molecular biologists.
               However, previous genome-wide studies of a diverse array of
               organisms found only weak, negative correlations between the
               importance of a gene and its evolutionary rate. We show, here,
               that the weakness of the correlation is not because gene
               importance measured in lab conditions deviates from that in an
               organism's natural environments. Neither is it due to a
               potentially biased among-gene distribution of functional
               density. We suggest that the weakness of the correlation is
               factual, rather than artifactual. These findings
               notwithstanding, we show that the principle of slower evolution
               of more important genes does have some predictive power when
               genes with vastly different evolutionary rates are compared,
               explaining why the principle can be practically useful for tasks
               such as identifying functional non-coding sequences despite the

  abstract = "Advances in biological techniques have led to the availability of
              genome-scale metabolic reconstructions for yeast. The size and
              complexity of such networks impose limits on what types of
              analyses one can perform. Constraint-based modelling overcomes
              some of these restrictions by using physicochemical constraints
              to describe the potential behaviour of an organism. FBA (flux
              balance analysis) highlights flux patterns through a network that
              serves to achieve a particular objective and requires a minimal
              amount of data to make quantitative inferences about network
              behaviour. Even though FBA is a powerful tool for system
              predictions, its general formulation sometimes results in
              unrealistic flux patterns. A typical example is fermentation in
              yeast: ethanol is produced during aerobic growth in excess
              glucose, but this pattern is not present in a typical FBA
              solution. In the present paper, we examine the issue of yeast
              fermentation against respiration during growth. We have studied a
              number of hypotheses from the modelling perspective, and novel
              formulations of the FBA approach have been tested. By making the
              observation that more respiration requires the synthesis of more
              mitochondria, an energy cost related to mitochondrial synthesis
              is added to the FBA formulation. Results, although still

              understanding of post-transcriptional gene regulation and its
              effects on protein complex stoichiometry are lagging
              behind.RESULTS:Here, we employ deep sequencing and iTRAQ
              technology to determine transcript and protein expression changes
              of a Drosophila brain tumor model at near genome-wide resolution.
              In total, we quantify more than 6,200 tissue-specific proteins,
              corresponding to about 70\% of all transcribed protein-coding
              genes. Using our integrated data set, we demonstrate that
              post-transcriptional gene regulation varies considerably with
              biological function and is surprisingly high for genes regulating
              transcription. We combine our quantitative data with
              protein-protein interaction data and show that
              post-transcriptional mechanisms significantly enhance
              co-regulation of protein complex subunits beyond transcriptional
              co-regulation. Interestingly, our results suggest that only about
              11\% of the annotated Drosophila protein complexes are
              co-regulated in the brain. Finally, we refine the composition of
              some of these core protein complexes by analyzing the
              co-regulation of potential subunits.CONCLUSIONS:Our comprehensive
              transcriptome and proteome data provide a valuable resource for

              sensitivity of tumours to food restriction remain unknown. Here
              we show that certain human cancer cell lines, when grown as
              tumour xenografts in mice, are highly sensitive to the
              anti-growth effects of dietary restriction, whereas others are
              resistant. Cancer cells that form dietary-restriction-resistant
              tumours carry mutations that cause constitutive activation of the
              phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) pathway and in culture
              proliferate in the absence of insulin or insulin-like growth

              wild-type PI3K in otherwise isogenic cancer cells, or the

              is sufficient to convert a dietary-restriction-resistant tumour

              restriction does not affect a PTEN-null mouse model of prostate
              cancer, but it significantly decreases tumour burden in a mouse
              model of lung cancer lacking constitutive PI3K signalling. Thus,
              the PI3K pathway is an important determinant of the sensitivity
              of tumours to dietary restriction, and activating mutations in
              the pathway may influence the response of cancers to dietary

              It has been thought that differentiated postmitotic cells have
              their genomes hard wired, with little ability for phenotypic
              plasticity. Here we show that transfer of the transcriptome from
              differentiated rat astrocytes into a nondividing differentiated
              rat neuron resulted in the conversion of the neuron into a
              functional astrocyte-like cell in a time-dependent manner. This
              single-cell study permits high resolution of molecular and
              functional components that underlie phenotype identity. The RNA
              population from astrocytes contains RNAs in the appropriate
              relative abundances that give rise to regulatory RNAs and
              translated proteins that enable astrocyte identity. When
              transferred into the postmitotic neuron, the astrocyte RNA
              population converts 44\% of the neuronal host cells into the
              destination astrocyte-like phenotype. In support of this
              observation, quantitative measures of cellular morphology,
              single-cell PCR, single-cell microarray, and single-cell
              functional analyses have been performed. The host-cell phenotypic
              changes develop over many weeks and are persistent. We call this

              Here, we present data suggesting that yeast Tor1 and Sch9 (a

               few minutes to several weeks. The reasons for this disparity
               have been thought to lie on different life-history strategies:
               fast-growing microbes grow extremely fast in rich media, but are
               less capable of dealing with stress and/or poor nutrient
               conditions. Prokaryotes have evolved a set of genomic traits to
               grow fast, including biased codon usage and transient or
               permanent gene multiplication for dosage effects. Here, we
               studied the relative role of these traits and show they can be
               used to predict minimal generation times from the genomic data
               of the vast majority of microbes that cannot be cultivated. We
               show that this inference can also be made with incomplete
               genomes and thus be applied to metagenomic data to test
               hypotheses about the biomass productivity of biotopes and the
               evolution of microbiota in the human gut after birth. Our
               results also allow a better understanding of the co-evolution
               between growth rates and genomic traits and how they can be

               variable in microbial physiology studies in the last century,

              than 10 years ago, many computational approaches have been
              developed aimed at using statistical associations between mRNA
              abundance profiles to predict transcriptional regulatory
              interactions. The ultimate goal is to develop causal network
              models describing the transcriptional influences that genes exert
              on each other (via their protein products), which can be used to
              predict network disruptions (e.g., mutations) leading to a
              disease phenotype, as well as the appropriate therapeutic
              intervention. However, microarray data measure only a small
              component of the interacting variables in a genetic regulatory
              network, as cells are known to regulate gene expression via many
              diverse mechanisms. Although many researchers have acknowledged
              the questionable interpretation of statistical dependencies
              between mRNA profiles, very little work has been done on
              theoretically characterizing the nature of inferred dependencies

              In this work, we review the theory behind reverse engineering

              theory, graphical models, and information theory-and highlight
              several mathematical relationships between the various methods.
              We then apply recent theoretical work on constructing graphical
              models with latent variables to the context of reverse
              engineering genetic networks. We demonstrate that even the

              cancer research for the last 50 years. Its premises are: (1)
              cancer is derived from a single somatic cell that has accumulated
              multiple DNA mutations, (2) the default state of cell
              proliferation in metazoa is quiescence, and (3) cancer is a
              disease of cell proliferation caused by mutations in genes that
              control proliferation and the cell cycle. From this compelling
              simplicity, an increasingly complicated picture has emerged as
              more than 100 oncogenes and 30 tumor suppressor genes have been
              identified. To accommodate this complexity, additional ad hoc
              explanations have been postulated. After a critical review of the

              program has been proposed. It is based on the tissue organization

              represents a problem of tissue organization, comparable to
              organogenesis, and that proliferation is the default state of all

              multiple copies of 30 different proteins known as nucleoporins.
              The evolutionarily conserved NPC proteins have the

              excess leads to a new steady state at increased metabolic fluxes

              behaviour has been rationalized as an adaptive metabolic
              strategy, the mechanism behind it remains unclear. Nevertheless,
              it is thought that, on glucose addition, a metabolite derived

              provides an opportunity to observe the evolutionary dynamics of
              adaptation in real time. Until very recently, however, such
              studies have been limited by our inability to systematically find
              mutations in evolved organisms. We overcome this limitation by
              using a variety of DNA microarray-based techniques to
              characterize genetic changes -- including point mutations,
              structural changes, and insertion variation -- that resulted from
              the experimental adaptation of 24 haploid and diploid cultures of
              Saccharomyces cerevisiae to growth in either glucose, sulfate, or
              phosphate-limited chemostats for approximately 200 generations.
              We identified frequent genomic amplifications and rearrangements
              as well as novel retrotransposition events associated with
              adaptation. Global nucleotide variation detection in ten clonal
              isolates identified 32 point mutations. On the basis of mutation
              frequencies, we infer that these mutations and the subsequent
              dynamics of adaptation are determined by the batch phase of
              growth prior to initiation of the continuous phase in the
              chemostat. We relate these genotypic changes to phenotypic
              outcomes, namely global patterns of gene expression, and to
              increases in fitness by 5-50\%. We found that the spectrum of
              available mutations in glucose- or phosphate-limited environments
              combined with the batch phase population dynamics early in our
              experiments allowed several distinct genotypic and phenotypic
              evolutionary pathways in response to these nutrient limitations.
              By contrast, sulfate-limited populations were much more
              constrained in both genotypic and phenotypic outcomes. Thus, the
              reproducibility of evolution varies with specific selective
              pressures, reflecting the constraints inherent in the
              system-level organization of metabolic processes in the cell. We
              were able to relate some of the observed adaptive mutations
              (e.g., transporter gene amplifications) to known features of the
              relevant metabolic pathways, but many of the mutations pointed to
              genes not previously associated with the relevant physiology.
              Thus, in addition to answering basic mechanistic questions about
              evolutionary mechanisms, our work suggests that experimental
              evolution can also shed light on the function and regulation of
              individual metabolic pathways.",

              actual statistical structure of affinity landscapes, although
              knowable, is currently unknown. Here, we analyze a class of
              mathematical models we call NK models. We show that these models
              capture significant features of the maturation of the immune
              response, which is currently thought to share features with
              general protein evolution. The NK models have the important
              property that, as the parameter K increases, the “ruggedness” of
              the NK landscape varies from a single peaked “Fujiyama” landscape
              to a multi-peaked “badlands” landscape. Walks to local optima on
              such landscapes become shorter as K increases. This fact allows
              us to choose a value of K that corresponds to the experimentally
              observed number of mutational “steps”, 6–8, taken as an antibody
              sequence matures. If the mature antibody is taken to correspond
              to a local optimum in the model, tuning the model requires that K
              be about 40, implying that the functional contribution of each
              amino acid in the V region is affected by about 40 others. Given
              this value of K, the model then predicts several features of
              “antibody space” that are in qualitative agreement with
              experiment: (1) The fraction of fitter variants of an initial
              “roughed in” germ line antibody amplified by clonal selection is
              about 1–2\%. (2) Mutations at some sites of the mature antibody
              hardly affect antibody function at all, but mutations at other
              sites dramatically decrease function. (3) The same “roughed in”
              antibody sequence can “walk” to many mature antibody sequences.
              (4) Many adaptive walks can end on the same local optimum. (5)
              Comparison of different mature sequences derived from the same
              initial V region shows evolutionary hot spots and parallel
              mutations. All these predictions are open to detailed testing by
              obtaining monoclonal antibodies early in the immune response and
              carrying out in vitro mutagenesis and adaptive hill climbing with
              respect to affinity for the immunizing antigen.",

              constructed based on the crystal structures of the Escherichia
              coli succinate dehydrogenase, the E. coli fumarate reductase, and
              the Wolinella succinogenes fumarate reductase. One FAD and three
              iron-sulfur clusters were docked into the Sdh1p and Sdh2p

              analog molecules were docked into the Sdh3p and Sdh4p membrane

  abstract = "The composition of phospholipids, sphingolipids, and sterols in
              the plasma membrane has a strong influence on the activity of the
              proteins associated or embedded in the lipid bilayer. Since most
              lipid-synthesizing enzymes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae are
              located in intracellular organelles, an extensive flux of lipids
              from these organelles to the plasma membrane is required.
              Although the pathway of protein traffic to the plasma membrane is
              similar to that of most of the lipids, the bulk flow of lipids is
              separate from vesicle-mediated protein transport. Recent advances
              in the analysis of membrane budding and membrane fusion indicate
              that the mechanisms of protein transport from the endoplasmic
              reticulum to the Golgi and from the Golgi to plasma membrane are
              similar. The majority of plasma membrane proteins transport
              solutes across the membrane. A number of ATP-dependent export
              systems have been detected that couple the hydrolysis of ATP to
              transport of molecules out of the cell. The hydrolysis of ATP by
              the plasma membrane H(+)-ATPase generates a proton motive force
              which is used to drive secondary transport processes. In S.
              cerevisiae, many substrates are transported by more than one
              system. Transport of monosaccharide is catalyzed by uniport
              systems, while transport of disaccharides, amino acids, and
              nucleosides is mediated by proton symport systems. Transport
              activity can be regulated at the level of transcription, e.g.,
              induction and (catabolite) repression, but transport proteins can
              also be affected posttranslationally by a process termed
              catabolite inactivation. Catabolite inactivation is triggered by
              the addition of fermentable sugars, intracellular acidification,
              stress conditions, and/or nitrogen starvation. Phosphorylation
              and/or ubiquitination of the transport proteins has been proposed
              as an initial step in the controlled inactivation and degradation
              of the target enzyme. The use of artificial membranes, like
              secretory vesicles and plasma membranes fused with

  abstract = "Intraperitoneal injection of 5 mumol of acetone/g, body weight,
              into 3 rats previously fed 1\% acetone (v/v) in their drinking
              water resulted in the appearance in blood serum of 16 +/- 2 nmol
              of 1,2-propanediol/ml and 8 +/- 1 nmol of 2,3-butanediol/ml. No
              detectable 1,2-propanediol or 2,3-butanediol was found in the
              serum of animals after acetone or saline injection without prior
              addition of acetone to drinking water or in the serum of animals
              injected with saline after having been maintained on drinking
              water containing 1\% acetone. These data suggest that acetone
              both acts to induce a critical enzyme or enzymes and serves as a
              precursor for the production of 1,2-propanediol. It is also clear
              from these data that chronic acetone feeding plays a role in
              2,3-butanediol production in the rat. Microsomes isolated from
              the liver of animals maintained on drinking water supplemented
              with 1\% acetone contained two previously unreported enzymatic
              activities, acetone monooxygenase which converts acetone to
              acetol and acetol monooxygenase which converts acetol to
              methylglyoxal. Both activities require O2 and NADPH. Prior
              treatment with acetone increased serum D-lactate from 9 nmol/ml
              +/- 9 nmol/ml in control animals to 77 +/- 36 nmol/ml in
              acetone-fed animals after injection with 5 mumol of acetone/g,
              body weight. This is consistent with methylglyoxal being a
              by-product of acetone metabolism. Two pathways for the conversion
              of acetone to glucose are proposed, the methylglyoxal and the
              propanediol pathways. The methylglyoxal pathway is responsible
              for the conversion of acetone to acetol, acetol to methylglyoxal,
              and the subsequent conversion of methylglyoxal to glucose. The
              propanediol pathway involves the conversion of acetol to
              L-1,2-propanediol by an as yet unknown process. L-1,2-Propanediol
              is converted to L-lactaldehyde by alcohol dehydrogenase, and
              L-lactaldehyde is converted to L-lactic acid by aldehyde
              dehydrogenase. Expression of these metabolic pathways in rat
              appears to be dependent on the induction of acetone monooxygenase
              and acetol monooxygenase by acetone.",

              little is known about how cells respond to lactic acidosis and
              how that response relates to cancer phenotypes. We develop
              genome-scale gene expression studies to dissect transcriptional
              responses of primary human mammary epithelial cells to lactic
              acidosis and hypoxia in vitro and to explore how they are linked
              to clinical tumor phenotypes in vivo. The resulting experimental
              signatures of responses to lactic acidosis and hypoxia are
              evaluated in a heterogeneous set of breast cancer datasets. A
              strong lactic acidosis response signature identifies a subgroup
              of low-risk breast cancer patients having distinct metabolic
              profiles suggestive of a preference for aerobic respiration. The
              association of lactic acidosis response with good survival
              outcomes may relate to the role of lactic acidosis in directing
              energy generation toward aerobic respiration and utilization of

              the fitness effects of new mutations show certain statistical
              properties. In particular, these models assume that the
              distribution of fitness effects among new mutations is in the
              domain of attraction of the so-called Gumbel-type extreme value
              distribution. This assumption has not, however, been justified on
              any biological or theoretical grounds. In this note, I study
              random mutation in one of the simplest models of mutation and
              adaptation-Fisher's geometric model. I show that random mutation
              in this model yields a distribution of mutational effects that
              belongs to the Gumbel type. I also show that the distribution of
              fitness effects among rare beneficial mutations in Fisher's model
              is asymptotically exponential. I confirm these analytic findings
              with exact computer simulations. These results provide some
              support for the use of Gumbel-type extreme value theory in
              studies of adaptation and point to a surprising connection
              between recent phenotypic- and sequence-based models of

              of sexuality remains one of the greatest unsolved problems in

              sex is an adaptation that allows deleterious mutations to be
              purged from the genome; it requires synergistic interactions,
              which means that two mutations would be more harmful together
              than expected from their separate effects. We generated 225
              genotypes of Escherichia coli carrying one, two or three
              successive mutations and measured their fitness relative to an
              unmutated competitor. The relationship between mutation number
              and average fitness is nearly log-linear. We also constructed 27
              recombinant genotypes having pairs of mutations whose separate
              and combined effects on fitness were determined. Several pairs
              exhibit significant interactions for fitness, but they are
              antagonistic as often as they are synergistic. These results do
              not support the mutational deterministic hypothesis for the

              performance can switch from an efficient working regime to a
              dissipative regime, and vice versa, depending on glucose
              availability. The efficient regime represents a good compromise
              between high output power and low dissipation, whereas the

              at a high glucose cost. The physiological and evolutionary

              cooperative behaviors, in the context of energetic metabolism.
              Glycolysis can perform either under a dissipative working regime
              suitable for rapid proliferation or under an efficient regime
              that entails a good modus operandi under conditions of glucose
              shortage. A cellular mechanism allowing switching between these
              two regimes may represent an evolutionary achievement. Thus, we
              have explored the conditions that might have favored the
              emergence of such an accommodative mechanism. Because of an
              inevitable conflict for resources between individual interests
              and the common good, rapid and inefficient use of glucose is
              always favored by natural selection in spatially homogeneous
              environment, regardless of the external conditions. In contrast,
              when the space is structured, the behavior of the system is
              determined by its free energy content. If the fuel is abundant,
              the dissipative strategy dominates the space. However, under
              famine conditions the efficient regime represents an evolutionary
              stable strategy in a Harmony game. Between these two extreme
              situations, both metabolic regimes are engaged in a Prisoner's
              Dilemma game, where the output depends on the extracellular free
              energy. The energy transition values that lead from one domain to
              another have been calculated. We conclude that an accommodative
              mechanism permitting alternation between dissipative and
              efficient regimes might have evolved in heterogeneous and highly
              fluctuating environments. Overall, the current work shows how

              feedback loop is part of a bistable trigger that makes the
              transition into mitosis abrupt and decisive. To generate a
              bistable response, some component of a double-negative feedback
              loop must exhibit an ultrasensitive response to its upstream
              regulator. Here, we experimentally demonstrate that Wee1 exhibits
              a highly ultrasensitive response to Cdk1. Several mechanisms can,
              in principle, give rise to ultrasensitivity, including zero-order
              effects, multisite phosphorylation, and competition mechanisms.
              We found that the ultrasensitivity in the inactivation of Wee1
              arises mainly through two competition mechanisms: competition
              between two sets of phosphorylation sites in Wee1 and between
              Wee1 and other high-affinity Cdk1 targets. Based on these
              findings, we were able to reconstitute a highly ultrasensitive
              Wee1 response with purified components. Competition provides a
              simple way of generating the equivalent of a highly cooperative

              single knockouts [Wilhelm, T., Behre, J., Schuster, S., 2004.
              Analysis of structural robustness of metabolic networks. IEE
              Proc. Syst. Biol. 1(1), 114-120], we are now considering the
              general case of double and multiple knockouts. The robustness
              measures are based on the ratio of the number of remaining EFMs
              after knockout vs. the number of EFMs in the unperturbed
              situation, averaged over all combinations of knockouts. With the
              help of simple examples we demonstrate that consideration of
              multiple knockouts yields additional information going beyond
              single-knockout results. It is proven that the robustness score
              decreases as the knockout depth increases. We apply our extended
              framework to metabolic networks representing amino acid anabolism
              in Escherichia coli and human hepatocytes, and the central
              metabolism in human erythrocytes. Moreover, in the E. coli model
              the two subnetworks synthesising amino acids that are essential
              and those that are non-essential for humans are studied
              separately. The results are discussed from an evolutionary
              viewpoint. We find that E. coli has the most robust metabolism of
              all the cell types studied here. Considering only the subnetwork
              of the synthesis of non-essential amino acids, E. coli and the
              human hepatocyte show about the same robustness.",

              independent measurements to determine the model parameters for
              the wild-type Escherichia coli strain W3110. We experimentally
              determined the maximum oxygen utilization rate (15 mmol of O2 per
              g [dry weight] per h), the maximum aerobic glucose utilization
              rate (10.5 mmol of Glc per g [dry weight] per h), the maximum

  abstract = "Cells rapidly alter gene expression in response to environmental
              stimuli such as nutrients, hormones, and drugs. During the

              differential recruitment of mRNAs to translating ribosomes. To
              systematically address this issue, we have established an
              approach to rapidly access the translational status of each mRNA
              in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae by affinity purification of
              endogenously formed ribosomes and the analysis of associated
              mRNAs with DNA microarrays. Using this method, we compared
              changes in total mRNA levels (transcriptome) with ribosome
              associations (translatome) after the application of different
              conditions of cellular stress. Severe stresses, induced by amino
              acid depletion or osmotic shock, stimulated highly correlated
              responses affecting about 15\% of both total RNA levels and
              translatome. Many of the regulated messages code for functionally
              related proteins, thus reflecting logical responses to the
              particular stress. In contrast, mild stress provoked by addition
              of Calcofluor-white and menadione altered the translatome of
              approximately 1\% of messages with only marginal effects on total
              mRNA, suggesting largely uncorrelated responses of transcriptome
              and translatome. Among these putative translationally regulated
              messages were most components of the mitochondrial ATPase.
              Increased polysome associations of corresponding messages and
              higher mitochondrial ATPase activities upon treatment confirmed
              the relevance for regulation of this macromolecular complex. Our
              results suggest the presence of highly sensitive translational
              regulatory networks that coordinate functionally related
              messages. These networks are preferentially activated for rapid
              adaptation of cells to minor environmental perturbations.",

              a model-based approach for the decomposition of expression to
              analyze these data and to identify functional modules which,
              expressed sequentially and periodically, contribute to the
              complex and intricate mitochondrial architecture. This approach
              revealed that mitochondrial spatio-temporal modules are expressed
              during periodic spikes and specific cellular localizations, which
              cover the entire oscillatory period. For instance, assembly
              factors (32 genes) and translation regulators (47 genes) are
              expressed earlier than the components of the amino-acid synthesis
              pathways (31 genes). In addition, we could correlate the

               pair is silenced in each cell of the female body. The particular
               copy of the X that is silenced nevertheless shows considerable
               variability among species, and the evolutionary causes for this
               variability remain unclear. Here, we show that X inactivation
               strategies are likely to evolve in response to the

               variation. Genetic variation with similar effects on male and

              May 2011.Abstract Serum starvation is one of the most frequently
              performed procedures in molecular biology and there are literally
              thousands of research papers reporting its use. In fact, this
              method has become so ingrained in certain areas of research that
              reports often simply state that cells were serum starved without
              providing any factual details as to how the procedure was carried
              out. Even so, we quite obviously lack unequivocal terminology,
              standard protocols, and perhaps most surprisingly, a common
              conceptual basis when performing serum starvation. Such
              inconsistencies not only hinder interstudy comparability but can
              lead to opposing and inconsistent experimental results. Although
              it is frequently assumed that serum starvation reduces basal
              activity of cells, available experimental data do not entirely
              support this notion. To address this important issue, we studied
              primary human myotubes, rat L6 myotubes and human embryonic
              kidney (HEK)293 cells under different serum starvation conditions
              and followed time-dependent changes in important signaling
              pathways such as the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2,
              the AMP-activated protein kinase, and the mammalian target of
              rapamycin. Serum starvation induced a swift and dynamic response,
              which displayed obvious qualitative and quantitative differences
              across different cell types and experimental conditions despite
              certain unifying features. There was no uniform reduction in
              basal signaling activity. Serum starvation clearly represents a
              major event that triggers a plethora of divergent responses and
              has therefore great potential to interfere with the experimental
              results and affect subsequent conclusions.serum-free mediumbasal

              certain human disease loci, but general mechanisms for their
              formation remain elusive. Here we investigate the distribution of
              single-nucleotide changes around insertions/deletions (indels) in
              six independent genome comparisons, including primates, rodents,
              fruitfly, rice and yeast. In each of these genomic comparisons,
              nucleotide divergence (D) is substantially elevated surrounding
              indels and decreases monotonically to near-background levels over
              several hundred bases. D is significantly correlated with both
              size and abundance of nearby indels. In comparisons of closely
              related species, derived nucleotide substitutions surrounding
              indels occur in significantly greater numbers in the lineage
              containing the indel than in the one containing the ancestral
              (non-indel) allele; the same holds within species for
              single-nucleotide mutations surrounding polymorphic indels. We
              propose that heterozygosity for an indel is mutagenic to
              surrounding sequences, and use yeast genome-wide polymorphism
              data to estimate the increase in mutation rate. The consistency
              of these patterns within and between species suggests that
              indel-associated substitution is a general mutational mechanism.",

              effects shape the protein's fitness landscape. Here we apply a
              model system in which bacterial fitness correlates with the
              enzymatic activity of TEM-1 beta-lactamase (antibiotic
              degradation). Subjecting TEM-1 to random mutational drift and
              purifying selection (to purge deleterious mutations) produced
              changes in its fitness landscape indicative of negative
              epistasis; that is, the combined deleterious effects of mutations
              were, on average, larger than expected from the multiplication of
              their individual effects. As observed in computational systems,
              negative epistasis was tightly associated with higher tolerance
              to mutations (robustness). Thus, under a low selection pressure,
              a large fraction of mutations was initially tolerated (high
              robustness), but as mutations accumulated, their fitness toll
              increased, resulting in the observed negative epistasis. These
              findings, supported by FoldX stability computations of the
              mutational effects, prompt a new model in which the mutational
              robustness (or neutrality) observed in proteins, and other
              biological systems, is due primarily to a stability margin, or
              threshold, that buffers the deleterious physico-chemical effects
              of mutations on fitness. Threshold robustness is inherently
              epistatic-once the stability threshold is exhausted, the

              derived from a particular system be transformed into data about
              another, different system? Such questions address the general

              meaning and usefulness of the concept of similarity is presented,
              and the necessity for a {"}prototype{"} is introduced. The

              systems and the purest form of model of such systems, the
              mathematical model. The value and limitations of Dimensional

               may identify cellular pathways contributing to the blood-borne

               anoikis, enhances anchorage-independent sphere formation, and
               increases metastatic propensity in vivo. This effect is
               correlated with fibronectin upregulation and suppressed by
               inhibition of MAP3K7 (also known as TAK1) kinase. In humans,
               formation of non-adherent tumour spheres by pancreatic cancer

               pancreatic CTCs revealed enrichment for WNT signalling in 5 out

              analysis can be performed to assess the capabilities of these
              reconstructed networks. The constraints-based framework, with
              flux balance analysis (FBA), has been used successfully to
              predict time course of growth and by-product secretion, effects
              of mutation and knock-outs, and gene expression profiles.
              However, FBA leads to incorrect predictions in situations where
              regulatory effects are a dominant influence on the behavior of
              the organism. Thus, there is a need to include regulatory events

              we represent transcriptional regulatory events as time-dependent
              constraints on the capabilities of a reconstructed metabolic

               is one of the most studied antioxidants in red wine and has been
               suggested to activate the longevity- and metabolism-associated
               histone deacetylase SIRT1. Here we show that relatively low
               concentrations of resveratrol (0.5-3 microM) specifically
               inhibited neuronal differentiation of neural stem cells in a
               SIRT1-dependent manner whereas higher concentrations of
               resveratrol (> or =10 microM) induced a SIRT1-independent cell
               death. Surprisingly, using a cell based assay, we found that
               small amounts of red wine (1-5\% v/v)--but not white
               wine--induced a massive and rapid cell death of various cell
               types, including neural stem cells and several cancer cell

               The TrxR inhibition correlated with the red color (absorbance at

              have been assembled in the past, bringing us to our present
              understanding of this area of research. The methods employed have
              relied heavily upon the genetics of yeast, worms, flies, mice,
              and humans. The use of second site suppressors and epistasis has
              permitted the detection of interacting elements and the sequence
              of genetic activities. Biochemistry has been employed to
              elucidate metabolic pathways, demonstrate protein complexes, and
              identify functions of gene products. The tools of molecular
              biology-knocking concentration of protein products down or
              up-have been helpful to trace the function of pathways in vivo.
              The study of disease states has led to the identification of a
              set of altered genes and helped define a network that is altered
              and gives rise to the disease. We will also discuss some serious
              limitations in these approaches. After reviewing how signal
              transduction pathways are constructed and investigated, we will
              turn our attention to an example that demonstrates the
              inter-relationships between pathways and the regulation of a
              specific set of pathways. We will examine how the p53 pathway in
              responding to stress shuts down the AKT-1 and mTOR pathways so as
              to limit the error frequency of cell growth and division during a

              respond and increase the fidelity of these processes.",

  abstract = "In Xenopus embryos, the cell cycle is driven by an autonomous
              biochemical oscillator that controls the periodic activation and
              inactivation of cyclin B1-CDK1. The oscillator circuit includes a
              system of three interlinked positive and double-negative feedback
              loops (CDK1 -> Cdc25 -> CDK1; CDK1 -/ Wee1 -/ CDK1; and CDK1 -/
              Myt1 -/ CDK1) that collectively function as a bistable trigger.
              Previous work established that this bistable trigger is essential
              for CDK1 oscillations in the early embryonic cell cycle. Here, we
              assess the importance of the trigger in the somatic cell cycle,
              where checkpoints and additional regulatory mechanisms could
              render it dispensable. Our approach was to express the
              phosphorylation site mutant CDK1AF, which short-circuits the
              feedback loops, in HeLa cells, and to monitor cell cycle
              progression by live cell fluorescence microscopy. We found that
              CDK1AF-expressing cells carry out a relatively normal first
              mitosis, but then undergo rapid cycles of cyclin B1 accumulation
              and destruction at intervals of 3-6 h. During these cycles, the
              cells enter and exit M phase-like states without carrying out
              cytokinesis or karyokinesis. Phenotypically similar rapid cycles
              were seen in Wee1 knockdown cells. These findings show that the
              interplay between CDK1, Wee1/Myt1, and Cdc25 is required for the
              establishment of G1 phase, for the normal approximately 20-h cell
              cycle period, and for the switch-like oscillations in cyclin B1
              abundance characteristic of the somatic cell cycle. We propose
              that the HeLa cell cycle is built upon an unreliable negative
              feedback oscillator and that the normal high reliability, slow
              pace and switch-like character of the cycle is imposed by a
              bistable CDK1/Wee1/Myt1/Cdc25 system.",

              is the so-called Quasi-Steady-State Assumption, which has the
              history of more than 80 years and has been proven very fruitful
              in analyzing the equations of enzyme kinetics. Many experimental
              results and numerical results have shown the validity of the

              it is always true, then it should be a law, not only an
              assumption. In this paper, we prove mathematically rigorously
              that it is indeed always true. Hence, it is a law, and we name it
              the Quasi-Steady-State Law. Actually, more precisely, we have two
              Quasi-Steady-State Laws. In one of them quasi-steady state means
              that the concentration of the enzyme-substrate complex remains

              area of yeast physiology. To investigate the physiology of
              Saccharomyces cerevisiae under these conditions, the effluent
              removal pipe of anaerobic, glucose-limited chemostat culture
              (dilution rate, 0.025 h(-1)) was fitted with a
              0.22-microm-pore-size polypropylene filter unit. This setup
              enabled prolonged cultivation with complete cell retention. After
              22 days of cultivation, specific growth rates had decreased below
              0.001 h(-1) (doubling time of >700 h). Over this period,
              viability of the retentostat cultures decreased to ca. 80\%. The
              viable biomass concentration in the retentostats could be
              accurately predicted by a maintenance coefficient of 0.50 mmol of
              glucose g(-1) of biomass h(-1) calculated from anaerobic,
              glucose-limited chemostat cultures grown at dilution rates of
              0.025 to 0.20 h(-1). This indicated that, in contrast to the
              situation in several prokaryotes, maintenance energy requirements
              in S. cerevisiae do not substantially change at near-zero
              specific growth rates. After 22 days of retentostat cultivation,
              glucose metabolism was predominantly geared toward alcoholic
              fermentation to meet maintenance energy requirements. The strict
              correlation between glycerol production and biomass formation
              observed at higher specific growth rates was not maintained at
              the near-zero growth rates reached in the retentostat cultures.
              In addition to glycerol, the organic acids acetate, d-lactate,
              and succinate were produced at low rates during prolonged
              retentostat cultivation. This study identifies robustness and

              predictions is the integration of transcriptional regulatory
              networks with the corresponding metabolic network. We propose a
              method called probabilistic regulation of metabolism (PROM) that
              achieves this synthesis and enables straightforward, automated,
              and quantitative integration of high-throughput data into
              constraint-based modeling, making it an ideal tool for
              constructing genome-scale regulatory-metabolic network models for
              less-studied organisms. PROM introduces probabilities to
              represent gene states and gene-transcription factor interactions.
              By using PROM, we constructed an integrated regulatory-metabolic
              network for the model organism, Escherichia coli, and
              demonstrated that our method based on automated inference is more
              accurate and comprehensive than the current state of the art,
              which is based on manual curation of literature. After validating
              the approach, we used PROM to build a genome-scale integrated
              metabolic-regulatory model for Mycobacterium tuberculosis, a
              critically important human pathogen. This study incorporated data

              identified KO phenotypes with accuracies as high as 95\%, and
              predicted growth rates quantitatively with correlation of 0.95.

              previous studies have documented glucose and fatty acid oxidation
              pathways. This study was aimed at characterizing the metabolism
              of other potentially important exogenous carbohydrate sources,
              namely, lactate and pyruvate. This was achieved by using
              (13)C-labeling methods. The mouse heart perfusion setup and
              buffer composition were optimized to reproduce conditions close
              to the in vivo milieu in terms of workload, cardiac functions,
              and substrate-hormone supply to the heart (11 mM glucose, 0.8 nM
              insulin, 50 microM carnitine, 1.5 mM lactate, 0.2 mM pyruvate, 5
              nM epinephrine, 0.7 mM oleate, and 3\% albumin). The use of three
              differentially (13)C-labeled carbohydrates and a (13)C-labeled
              long-chain fatty acid allowed the quantitative assessment of the

              and fatty acids) and oxaloacetate (pyruvate) for mitochondrial
              citrate synthesis. Beyond concurring with the notion that the
              mouse heart preferentially uses fatty acids for energy production
              (63.5 +/- 3.9\%) and regulates its fuel selection according to
              the Randle cycle, our study reports for the first time in the
              mouse heart the following findings. First, exogenous lactate is
              the major carbohydrate contributing to pyruvate formation (42.0
              +/- 2.3\%). Second, lactate and pyruvate are constantly being
              taken up and released by the heart, supporting the concept of
              compartmentation of lactate and glucose metabolism. Finally,
              mitochondrial anaplerotic pyruvate carboxylation and citrate
              efflux represent 4.9 +/- 1.8 and 0.8 +/- 0.1\%, respectively, of
              the citric acid cycle flux and are modulated by substrate supply.

               high-throughput epistasis data from model organisms are being
               generated and used to construct genetic networks, the extent to
               which genetic epistasis reflects biologically meaningful
               interactions remains unclear. We have addressed this question
               through in silico mapping of positive and negative epistatic
               interactions amongst biochemical reactions within the metabolic
               networks of Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae using
               flux balance analysis. We found that negative epistasis occurs
               mainly between nonessential reactions with overlapping
               functions, whereas positive epistasis usually involves essential
               reactions, is highly abundant and, unexpectedly, often occurs
               between reactions without overlapping functions. We offer
               mechanistic explanations of these findings and experimentally
               validate them for 61 S. cerevisiae gene pairs.",

              depend on the environment (plasticity), the presence of
              compensatory mechanisms (mutational robustness), or both. Here,
              we analyze the interaction between these two forces by exploring
              the condition-dependence of synthetic genetic interactions that
              define redundant functions and alternative pathways. We performed
              systems-level flux balance analysis of the yeast (Saccharomyces
              cerevisiae) metabolic network to identify genetic interactions
              and then tested the model's predictions with in vivo
              gene-deletion studies. We found that the majority of synthetic
              genetic interactions are restricted to certain environmental
              conditions, partly because of the lack of compensation under some
              (but not all) nutrient conditions. Moreover, the phylogenetic
              cooccurrence of synthetically interacting pairs is not
              significantly different from random expectation. These findings
              suggest that these gene pairs have at least partially independent
              functions, and, hence, compensation is only a byproduct of their
              evolutionary history. Experimental analyses that used multiple
              gene deletion strains not only confirmed predictions of the model
              but also showed that investigation of false predictions may both
              improve functional annotation within the model and also lead to
              the discovery of higher-order genetic interactions. Our work
              supports the view that functional redundancy may be more apparent
              than real, and it offers a unified framework for the evolution of
              environmental adaptation and mutational robustness.",

  abstract = "Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) functions as a second messenger that can
              activate cell proliferation through chemoselective oxidation of
              cysteine residues in signaling proteins. The connection between
              H2O2 signaling, thiol oxidation, and activation of growth
              pathways has emerged as fertile ground for the development of
              strategies for cancer treatment. Central to achieving this goal
              is the development of tools and assays that facilitate
              characterization of the molecular events associated with
              tumorigenesis and evaluation of patient response to therapy. Here
              we report on the development of an immunochemical method for
              detecting sulfenic acid, the initial oxidation product that
              results when a thiolate reacts with H2O2. For this approach, the
              sulfenic acid is derivatized with a chemical tag to generate a
              unique epitope for recognition. The elicited antibody is
              exquisitely specific, context-independent, and capable of
              visualizing sulfenic acid formation in cells. Applying this
              approach to several systems, including cancer cell lines, shows
              it can be used to monitor differences in thiol redox status and
              reveals a diverse pattern of sulfenic acid modifications across
              different subtypes of breast tumors. These studies demonstrate a
              general strategy for producing antibodies against a specific
              oxidation state of cysteine and show the utility of these
              reagents for profiling thiol oxidation associated with

              using annotated genome sequence information, well-curated

              reaction stoichiometry and other physicochemical factors are
              incorporated into the model, thus imposing constraints that
              represent restrictions on phenotypic behavior. Based on this
              premise, the theoretical capabilities of the metabolic network
              can be assessed by using a mathematical technique known as flux
              balance analysis (FBA). This modeling framework, also known as
              the constraint-based reconstruction and analysis approach,
              differs from other modeling strategies because it does not
              attempt to predict exact network behavior. Instead, this approach
              uses known constraints to separate the states that a system can
              achieve from those that it cannot. In recent years, this strategy
              has been employed to probe the metabolic capabilities of a number

              to predict accurately metabolic phenotypes and evolutionary

               in complete genome sequences, accompanied by great advances in
               our understanding of genome evolution. Although little is known
               about the natural and life histories of yeasts in the wild,
               there are an increasing number of studies looking at ecological
               and geographic distributions, population structure and sexual
               versus asexual reproduction. Less well understood at the whole
               genome level are the evolutionary processes acting within
               populations and species that lead to adaptation to different
               environments, phenotypic differences and reproductive isolation.
               Here we present one- to fourfold or more coverage of the genome
               sequences of over seventy isolates of the baker's yeast S.
               cerevisiae and its closest relative, Saccharomyces paradoxus. We

               relationships. S. paradoxus populations are well delineated
               along geographic boundaries, whereas the variation among
               worldwide S. cerevisiae isolates shows less differentiation and
               is comparable to a single S. paradoxus population. Rather than
               one or two domestication events leading to the extant baker's

               few well-defined, geographically isolated lineages and many

              find a maximum a posteriori probability alignment for a pair
              hidden Markov model (PHMM). To process large genomes that have
              undergone complex genome rearrangements, almost all existing
              whole genome alignment methods apply fast heuristics to divide
              genomes into small pieces that are suitable for Needleman-Wunsch
              alignment. In these alignment methods, it is standard practice to
              fix the parameters and to produce a single alignment for
              subsequent analysis by biologists. As the number of alignment
              programs applied on a whole genome scale continues to increase,
              so does the disagreement in their results. The alignments
              produced by different programs vary greatly, especially in
              non-coding regions of eukaryotic genomes where the biologically
              correct alignment is hard to find. Parametric alignment is one
              possible remedy. This methodology resolves the issue of
              robustness to changes in parameters by finding all optimal
              alignments for all possible parameters in a PHMM. Our main result
              is the construction of a whole genome parametric alignment of
              Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila pseudoobscura. This
              alignment draws on existing heuristics for dividing whole genomes
              into small pieces for alignment, and it relies on advances we
              have made in computing convex polytopes that allow us to
              parametrically align non-coding regions using biologically
              realistic models. We demonstrate the utility of our parametric
              alignment for biological inference by showing that cis-regulatory
              elements are more conserved between Drosophila melanogaster and
              Drosophila pseudoobscura than previously thought. We also show
              how whole genome parametric alignment can be used to
              quantitatively assess the dependence of branch length estimates

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: The unique metabolism of tumors was described many
              years ago by Otto Warburg, who identified tumor cells with
              increased glycolysis and decreased mitochondrial activity.
              However, {"}aerobic glycolysis{"} generates fewer ATP per glucose
              molecule than mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, so in
              terms of energy production, it is unclear how increasing a less
              efficient process provides tumors with a growth advantage.
              METHODS/FINDINGS: We carried out a screen for loss of genetic
              elements in pancreatic tumor cells that accelerated their growth
              as tumors, and identified mitochondrial ribosomal protein L28
              (MRPL28). Knockdown of MRPL28 in these cells decreased
              mitochondrial activity, and increased glycolysis, but
              paradoxically, decreased cellular growth in vitro. Following
              Warburg's observations, this mutation causes decreased
              mitochondrial function, compensatory increase in glycolysis and
              accelerated growth in vivo. Likewise, knockdown of either
              mitochondrial ribosomal protein L12 (MRPL12) or cytochrome
              oxidase had a similar effect. Conversely, expression of the
              mitochondrial uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) increased oxygen
              consumption and decreased tumor growth. Finally, treatment of
              tumor bearing animals with dichloroacetate (DCA) increased
              pyruvate consumption in the mitochondria, increased total oxygen
              consumption, increased tumor hypoxia and slowed tumor growth.
              CONCLUSIONS: We interpret these findings to show that
              non-oncogenic genetic changes that alter mitochondrial metabolism
              can regulate tumor growth through modulation of the consumption
              of oxygen, which appears to be a rate limiting substrate for
              tumor proliferation.",

  abstract = "MOTIVATION: Many biological phenomena involve extensive
              interactions between many of the biological pathways present in
              cells. However, extraction of all the inherent biological
              pathways remains a major challenge in systems biology. With the
              advent of high-throughput functional genomic techniques, it is
              now possible to infer biological pathways and pathway
              organization in a systematic way by integrating disparate
              biological information. RESULTS: Here, we propose a novel
              integrated approach that uses network topology to predict
              biological pathways. We integrated four types of biological
              evidence (protein-protein interaction, genetic interaction,
              domain-domain interaction and semantic similarity of Gene
              Ontology terms) to generate a functionally associated network.
              This network was then used to develop a new pathway finding
              algorithm to predict biological pathways in yeast. Our approach
              discovered 195 biological pathways and 31 functionally redundant
              pathway pairs in yeast. By comparing our identified pathways to
              three public pathway databases (KEGG, BioCyc and Reactome), we
              observed that our approach achieves a maximum positive predictive
              value of 12.8\% and improves on other predictive approaches. This
              study allows us to reconstruct biological pathways and delineates

              systematic study of palindromes at the whole genome level, we
              developed a computer program that can identify, locate and count
              palindromes in a given sequence in a strictly defined way. All
              palindromes, defined as identical inverted repeats without spacer
              DNA, can be analyzed and sorted according to their size,
              frequency, GC content or alphabetically. This program was then
              used to prepare a catalog of all palindromes present in the
              chromosomal DNA of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. For each
              palindrome size, the observed palindrome counts were
              significantly different from those in the randomly generated
              equivalents of the yeast genome. However, while the short
              palindromes (2-12 bp) were under-represented, the palindromes
              longer than 12 bp were over-represented, AT-rich and
              preferentially located in the intergenic regions. The 44-bp
              palindrome found between the genes CDC53 and LYS21 on chromosome
              IV was the longest palindrome identified and contained only two
              C-G base pairs. Avoidance of coding regions was also observed for
              palindromes of 4-12 bp, but was less pronounced. Dinucleotide
              analysis indicated a strong bias against palindromic
              dinucleotides that could explain the observed short palindrome

              properties of extreme pathways (pathways that cannot be the
              result of combining other pathways) of metabolic networks,
              contrasting them to those of elementary flux modes (pathways

              that an extreme pathway can be recognized by a rank test as
              simple as the existing rank test for elementary flux modes,
              without computing all the modes. We make the observation that,
              unlike elementary flux modes, the property of being an extreme
              pathway depends on the presence or absence of reactions beyond
              those involved in the pathway itself. Hence, the property of
              being an extreme pathway is not a local property. As a
              consequence, we find that the set of all elementary flux modes
              for a network includes all the elementary flux modes for all its
              subnetworks, but that this property does not hold for the set of

              We analyse experimental data as well as models in two distinct
              cases: the relaxation-like oscillations seen in yeast extracts,
              and the sinusoidal Hopf oscillations seen in intact yeast cells.
              In the case of yeast extracts, we use flux-change plots and model
              analyses to establish that the oscillations are driven by on/off
              switching of phosphofructokinase. In the case of intact yeast
              cells, we find that the instability leading to the appearance of
              oscillations is caused by the stoichiometry of the ATP-ADP-AMP
              system and the allosteric regulation of phosphofructokinase,
              whereas frequency control is distributed over the reaction
              network. Notably, the NAD+/NADH ratio modulates the frequency of
              the oscillations without affecting the instability. This is
              important for understanding the mutual synchronization of
              oscillations in the individual yeast cells, as synchronization is
              believed to occur via acetaldehyde, which in turn affects the
              frequency of oscillations by changing this ratio.",

  title     = "On the karyotypic origin and evolution of cancer cells",
  author    = "Nicholson, Joshua M and Duesberg, Peter",
  abstract  = "Cancers have clonal, aneuploid karyotypes that evolve ever more
               malignant phenotypes spontaneously. Because these facts are hard
               to explain by conventional mutation theory, we propose here a
               karyotypic cancer theory. According to this theory, carcinogens
               initiate carcinogenesis by inducing random aneuploidy.
               Aneuploidy then catalyzes karyotypic evolutions, because it
               destabilizes the karyotype by unbalancing teams of proteins that
               segregate, synthesize, and repair chromosomes. Sporadically,
               such evolutions generate new cancer-causing karyotypes, which
               are stabilized within narrow limits against the inherent
               instability of aneuploidy by selection for oncogenic function.
               Here we have tested this theory prospectively by analyzing the
               karyotypes of distinct tumorigenic clones, which arose from mass
               cultures of human cells within a few months after transfection
               with artificially activated oncogenes. All clones from the same
               parental cells had individual, {"}near-clonal{"} karyotypes and
               phenotypes, although the parental oncogenes were identical. The
               karyotypes of distinct tumors formed by a given clone in
               immunodeficient mice were variants of those of the input clones.
               The karyotypes of tumorigenic clones also evolved on passages in
               vitro, in which they acquired either enhanced tumorigenicity
               spontaneously or resistance against methotrexate upon selection.
               We conclude that activated oncogenes initiate carcinogenesis
               indirectly by inducing random aneuploidy, much like conventional
               carcinogens, but more effectively because the oncogenes are
               integrated into the genome. Since aneuploidy destabilizes the
               karyotype, such cells evolve new, cancer-specific karyotypes
               spontaneously, much like new species. Because individual
               karyotypes of tumorigenic clones correlate and coevolve with
               individual phenotypes, we conclude that specific karyotypes as a
               whole are the genomes of cancer cells. Owing to the flexibility
               of their aneuploid karyotypes, cancers evolve at rates that are
               roughly proportional to their degrees of aneuploidy. In sum,
               genomes consisting of individual and flexible karyotypes explain
               the characteristic individuality, stability, and flexibility of
               cancers.",

               be discovered using randomized experiments; however such
               experiments are often costly, infeasible, or unethical.
               Fortunately, algorithms that infer causal interactions from
               observational data have been in development for decades,
               predominantly in the quantitative sciences, and many of them

              We analyzed the effects of epistasis on fitness for the first
              five mutations to fix in an experimental population of
              Escherichia coli. Epistasis depended on the effects of the
              combined mutations--the larger the expected benefit, the more
              negative the epistatic effect. Epistasis thus tended to produce
              diminishing returns with genotype fitness, although interactions
              involving one particular mutation had the opposite effect. These
              data support models in which negative epistasis contributes to
              declining rates of adaptation over time. Sign epistasis was rare

              the evolution of sex, the rate of adaptation and the conservation

              in small groups, then competition can easily lead to a type of

              that a deleterious mutation is most damaging in a genome that
              already has many other deleterious mutations. We also show that

              the flux through each pathway influences the overall behavior of
              metabolism. A stoichiometric matrix accounting for the major
              pathways involved in energy and mass transformations in the cell
              was used in our analysis. The auxiliary parameters of linear
              optimization, the so-called shadow prices, identify the
              intermediates and cofactors that cause the growth to be limited
              on each nutrient. This formalism was used to examine how well the
              cell balances its needs for carbon, nitrogen, and energy during
              growth on different substrates. The relative values of glucose
              and glutamine as nutrients were compared by varying the ratio of
              rates of glucose to glutamine uptakes, and calculating the
              maximum growth rate. The optimum value of this ratio is between
              2-7, similar to experimentally observed ratios. The theoretical

               development and progression. Deciphering the molecular networks
               that distinguish organ-confined disease from metastatic disease
               may lead to the identification of critical biomarkers for cancer
               invasion and disease aggressiveness. Although gene and protein
               expression have been extensively profiled in human tumours,
               little is known about the global metabolomic alterations that
               characterize neoplastic progression. Using a combination of
               high-throughput liquid-and-gas-chromatography-based mass
               spectrometry, we profiled more than 1,126 metabolites across 262
               clinical samples related to prostate cancer (42 tissues and 110
               each of urine and plasma). These unbiased metabolomic profiles
               were able to distinguish benign prostate, clinically localized
               prostate cancer and metastatic disease. Sarcosine, an N-methyl
               derivative of the amino acid glycine, was identified as a
               differential metabolite that was highly increased during
               prostate cancer progression to metastasis and can be detected
               non-invasively in urine. Sarcosine levels were also increased in
               invasive prostate cancer cell lines relative to benign prostate
               epithelial cells. Knockdown of glycine-N-methyl transferase, the
               enzyme that generates sarcosine from glycine, attenuated
               prostate cancer invasion. Addition of exogenous sarcosine or
               knockdown of the enzyme that leads to sarcosine degradation,
               sarcosine dehydrogenase, induced an invasive phenotype in benign
               prostate epithelial cells. Androgen receptor and the ERG gene
               fusion product coordinately regulate components of the sarcosine
               pathway. Here, by profiling the metabolomic alterations of
               prostate cancer progression, we reveal sarcosine as a
               potentially important metabolic intermediary of cancer cell

              that is based on an algorithm for rapidly checking whether single
              matches are consistent with a partial multiple alignment. This
              leads to a sequence annealing algorithm, which is an incremental
              method for building multiple sequence alignments one match at a
              time. Our approach improves significantly on the standard
              progressive alignment approach to multiple alignment. RESULTS:
              The sequence annealing algorithm performs well on benchmark test
              sets of protein sequences. It is not only sensitive, but also
              specific, drastically reducing the number of incorrectly aligned
              residues in comparison to other programs. The method allows for
              adjustment of the sensitivity/specificity tradeoff and can be
              used to reliably identify homologous regions among protein
              sequences. AVAILABILITY: An implementation of the sequence

              fluxes that are feasible at steady state. We use the local

              surfaces coated with either gelatin (GEL) or matrigel (MAT). MFA
              was based on 15 metabolic reactions and eight transport steps,
              and was carried out based on measurements of four substrates
              and/or metabolites: glucose, lactate, glutamine, and glutamate.
              Fluxes representing biomass production remained fairly constant
              for all three culture conditions with at most a 40\% variation.
              In contrast, major temporal variations, up to 500\%, were
              observed for all other major central metabolic fluxes across all
              culture conditions. Fluxes were compared to gene-expression
              patterns measured by microarray analysis. Particularly
              interesting is the correlation between the metabolic fluxes with
              expression patterns of the corresponding genes of the pyruvate to
              lactate reaction, whereby the genes for several isoforms of the

              novel finding of this study is an event occurring between Days 4
              and 5 of differentiation, which was identified by a notable
              change in both the metabolic fluxes and gene-expression patterns.
              This suggests that metabolic patterns can be used as effective
              beacons of changes in differentiating stem cells. Overall, and

              multienzyme (PDH) complex of eucaryotic cells has been carried
              out using both in vitro and in vivo mechanistic models. Flux
              control coefficients (FCC) for the sensitivity of pyruvate
              decarboxylation rate to activities of various PDH complex
              reactions are determined. FCCs are shown to be strong functions
              of both pyruvate levels and various components of PDH complex.
              With the in vitro model, FCCs are shown to be sensitive to only
              the E1 component of the PDH complex at low pyruvate
              concentrations. At high pyruvate concentrations, the control is
              shared by all of the components, with E1 having a negative
              influence while the other three components, E2, X, and K, exert a
              positive control over the pyruvate decarboxylation rate. An
              unusual behavior of deactivation of the E1 component leading to
              higher net PDH activity is shown to be linked to the combined
              effect of protein X acylation and E1 deactivation. The
              steady-state analysis of the in vivo model reveals multiple
              steady state behavior of pyruvate metabolism with two stable and
              one unstable steady-states branches. FCCs also display
              multiplicity, showing completely different control distribution
              exerted by pyruvate and PDH components on three branches. At low
              pyruvate concentrations, pyruvate supply dominates the
              decarboxylation rate and PDH components do not exert any
              significant control. Reverse control distribution is observed at
              high pyruvate concentration. The effect of dilution due to cell
              growth on pyruvate metabolism is investigated in detail. While
              pyruvate dilution effects are shown to be negligible under all
              conditions, significant PDH complex dilution effects are observed
              under certain conditions. Comparison of in vitro and in vivo
              models shows that PDH components exert different degrees of
              control outside and inside the cells. At high pyruvate levels,
              PDH components are shown to exert a higher degree of control when
              reactions are taking place inside the cells as compared to the in

  abstract = "Under laboratory conditions 80\% of yeast genes seem not to be
              essential for viability. This raises the question of what the
              mechanistic basis for dispensability is, and whether it is the
              result of selection for buffering or an incidental side product.
              Here we analyse these issues using an in silico flux model of the
              yeast metabolic network. The model correctly predicts the
              knockout fitness effects in 88\% of the genes studied and in vivo
              fluxes. Dispensable genes might be important, but under
              conditions not yet examined in the laboratory. Our model
              indicates that this is the dominant explanation for apparent
              dispensability, accounting for 37-68\% of dispensable genes,
              whereas 15-28\% of them are compensated by a duplicate, and only
              4-17\% are buffered by metabolic network flux reorganization. For
              over one-half of those not important under nutrient-rich
              conditions, we can predict conditions when they will be
              important. As expected, such condition-specific genes have a more
              restricted phylogenetic distribution. Gene duplicates catalysing
              the same reaction are not more common for indispensable
              reactions, suggesting that the reason for their retention is not
              to provide compensation. Instead their presence is better

  abstract = "Complex regulatory networks control the transcription state of a
              genome. These transcriptional regulatory networks (TRNs) have
              been mathematically described using a Boolean formalism, in which
              the state of a gene is represented as either transcribed or not
              transcribed in response to regulatory signals. The Boolean
              formalism results in a series of regulatory rules for the
              individual genes of a TRN that in turn can be used to link
              environmental cues to the transcription state of a genome,
              thereby forming a complete transcriptional regulatory system
              (TRS). Herein, we develop a formalism that represents such a set
              of regulatory rules in a matrix form. Matrix formalism allows for
              the systemic characterization of the properties of a TRS and
              facilitates the computation of the transcriptional state of the
              genome under any given set of environmental conditions.
              Additionally, it provides a means to incorporate mechanistic
              detail of a TRS as it becomes available. In this study, the
              regulatory network matrix, R, for a prototypic TRS is
              characterized and the fundamental subspaces of this matrix are
              described. We illustrate how the matrix representation of a TRS
              coupled with its environment (R*) allows for a sampling of all
              possible expression states of a given network, and furthermore,
              how the fundamental subspaces of the matrix provide a way to
              study key TRS features and may assist in experimental design.",

  author   = "Dingel, Janis and Milenkovic, Olgica",
  abstract = "MOTIVATION: The problem of reverse engineering the dynamics of
              gene expression profiles is of focal importance in systems
              biology. Due to noise and the inherent lack of sufficiently large
              datasets generated via high-throughput measurements, known
              reconstruction frameworks based on dynamical systems models fail
              to provide adequate settings for network analysis. This motivates
              the study of new approaches that produce stochastic lists of
              explanations for the observed network dynamics that can be
              efficiently inferred from small sample sets and in the presence
              of errors. RESULTS: We introduce a novel algebraic modeling
              framework, termed stochastic polynomial dynamical systems (SPDSs)
              that can capture the dynamics of regulatory networks based on
              microarray expression data. Here, we refer to dynamics of the
              network as the trajectories of gene expression profiles over
              time. The model assumes that the expression data is quantized in
              a manner that allows for imposing a finite field structure on the
              observations, and the existence of polynomial update functions
              for each gene in the network. The underlying reverse engineering
              algorithm is based on ideas borrowed from coding theory, and in
              particular, list-decoding methods for so called Reed-Muller
              codes. The list-decoding method was tested on synthetic data and
              on microarray expression measurements from the M(3D) database,
              corresponding to a subnetwork of the Escherichia coli SOS repair
              system, as well as on the complete transcription factor network,
              available at RegulonDB. The results show that SPDSs constructed
              via list-decoders significantly outperform other algebraic
              reverse engineering methods, and that they also provide good
              guidelines for estimating the influence of genes on the dynamics
              of the network. AVAILABILITY: Software codes for list-decoding
              algorithms suitable for direct application to quantized
              expression data will be publicly available at the authors'

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Quantification of intracellular metabolite fluxes by
              13C-tracer experiments is maturing into a routine
              higher-throughput analysis. The question now arises as to which
              mutants should be analyzed. Here we identify key experiments in a
              systems biology approach with a genome-scale model of
              Saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolism, thereby reducing the
              workload for experimental network analyses and functional
              genomics. RESULTS: Genome-scale 13C flux analysis revealed that
              about half of the 745 biochemical reactions were active during
              growth on glucose, but that alternative pathways exist for only
              51 gene-encoded reactions with significant flux. These flexible
              reactions identified in silico are key targets for experimental
              flux analysis, and we present the first large-scale metabolic
              flux data for yeast, covering half of these mutants during growth
              on glucose. The metabolic lesions were often counteracted by flux
              rerouting, but knockout of cofactor-dependent reactions, as in
              the adh1, ald6, cox5A, fum1, mdh1, pda1, and zwf1 mutations,
              caused flux responses in more distant parts of the network. By
              integrating computational analyses, flux data, and physiological
              phenotypes of all mutants in active reactions, we quantified the
              relative importance of 'genetic buffering' through alternative
              pathways and network redundancy through duplicate genes for
              genetic robustness of the network. CONCLUSIONS: The apparent
              dispensability of knockout mutants with metabolic function is
              explained by gene inactivity under a particular condition in
              about half of the cases. For the remaining 207 viable mutants of
              active reactions, network redundancy through duplicate genes was
              the major (75\%) and alternative pathways the minor (25\%)

              data is one of the central problems in computational biology. In
              this paper, we describe a predictive modeling approach for
              studying regulatory networks, based on a machine learning
              algorithm called MEDUSA. MEDUSA integrates promoter sequence,
              mRNA expression, and transcription factor occupancy data to learn
              gene regulatory programs that predict the differential expression
              of target genes. Instead of using clustering or correlation of
              expression profiles to infer regulatory relationships, MEDUSA
              determines condition-specific regulators and discovers regulatory
              motifs that mediate the regulation of target genes. In this way,
              MEDUSA meaningfully models biological mechanisms of
              transcriptional regulation. MEDUSA solves the problem of
              predicting the differential (up/down) expression of target genes
              by using boosting, a technique from statistical learning, which
              helps to avoid overfitting as the algorithm searches through the
              high-dimensional space of potential regulators and sequence
              motifs. Experimental results demonstrate that MEDUSA achieves
              high prediction accuracy on held-out experiments (test data),
              that is, data not seen in training. We also present
              context-specific analysis of MEDUSA regulatory programs for DNA
              damage and hypoxia, demonstrating that MEDUSA identifies key
              regulators and motifs in these processes. A central challenge in
              the field is the difficulty of validating reverse-engineered
              networks in the absence of a gold standard. Our approach of
              learning regulatory programs provides at least a partial solution
              for the problem: MEDUSA's prediction accuracy on held-out data
              gives a concrete and statistically sound way to validate how well
              the algorithm performs. With MEDUSA, statistical validation
              becomes a prerequisite for hypothesis generation and network
              building rather than a secondary consideration.",

              as excitatory neurotransmitter excess occurring during seizures,

  abstract = "MOTIVATION: The effort to build a whole-cell model requires the
              development of new modeling approaches, and in particular, the
              integration of models for different types of processes, each of
              which may be best described using different representation.
              Flux-balance analysis (FBA) has been useful for large-scale
              analysis of metabolic networks, and methods have been developed
              to incorporate transcriptional regulation (regulatory FBA, or
              rFBA). Of current interest is the integration of these approaches
              with detailed models based on ordinary differential equations
              (ODEs). RESULTS: We developed an approach to modeling the dynamic
              behavior of metabolic, regulatory and signaling networks by
              combining FBA with regulatory Boolean logic, and ordinary
              differential equations. We use this approach (called integrated
              FBA, or iFBA) to create an integrated model of Escherichia coli
              which combines a flux-balance-based, central carbon metabolic and
              transcriptional regulatory model with an ODE-based, detailed
              model of carbohydrate uptake control. We compare the predicted
              Escherichia coli wild-type and single gene perturbation
              phenotypes for diauxic growth on glucose/lactose and
              glucose/glucose-6-phosphate with that of the individual models.
              We find that iFBA encapsulates the dynamics of three internal
              metabolites and three transporters inadequately predicted by
              rFBA. Furthermore, we find that iFBA predicts different and more
              accurate phenotypes than the ODE model for 85 of 334 single gene
              perturbation simulations, as well for the wild-type simulations.
              We conclude that iFBA is a significant improvement over the
              individual rFBA and ODE modeling paradigms. AVAILABILITY: All

              optimal fluxes. Previously, these techniques have been used to
              obtain optimal fluxes that maximize a single objective. Because
              mammalian systems perform various functions, a multi-objective
              approach is needed when seeking optimal flux distributions in
              such systems. For example, hepatocytes perform several metabolic
              functions at various levels depending on environmental
              conditions; furthermore, there is a potential benefit to enhance
              some of these functions for applications such as bioartificial
              liver (BAL) support devices. Herein we developed a
              multi-objective optimization approach that couples the normalized
              Normal Constraint (NC) with both FBA and EBA to obtain
              multi-objective Pareto-optimal solutions. We investigated the

              experimental flux measurements on the Pareto frontiers. We found
              that measurements induce dramatic changes in Pareto frontiers and
              further constrain the network fluxes. This multi-objective
              optimality analysis may help explain certain features of the

  author   = "Wang, Zhi and Zhang, Jianzhi",
  abstract = "Many complex networks such as computer and social networks
              exhibit modular structures, where links between nodes are much
              denser within modules than between modules. It is widely believed
              that cellular networks are also modular, reflecting the relative
              independence and coherence of different functional units in a
              cell. While many authors have claimed that observations from the
              yeast protein-protein interaction (PPI) network support the above
              hypothesis, the observed structural modularity may be an artifact
              because the current PPI data include interactions inferred from
              protein complexes through approaches that create modules (e.g.,
              assigning pairwise interactions among all proteins in a complex).
              Here we analyze the yeast PPI network including protein complexes
              (PIC network) and excluding complexes (PEC network). We find that
              both PIC and PEC networks show a significantly greater structural
              modularity than that of randomly rewired networks. Nonetheless,
              there is little evidence that the structural modules correspond
              to functional units, particularly in the PEC network. More
              disturbingly, there is no evolutionary conservation among yeast,
              fly, and nematode modules at either the whole-module or
              protein-pair level. Neither is there a correlation between the
              evolutionary or phylogenetic conservation of a protein and the
              extent of its participation in various modules. Using computer
              simulation, we demonstrate that a higher-than-expected modularity
              can arise during network growth through a simple model of gene
              duplication, without natural selection for modularity. Taken
              together, our results suggest the intriguing possibility that the
              structural modules in the PPI network originated as an
              evolutionary byproduct without biological significance.",

  abstract = "After whole-genome duplication (WGD), deletions return most loci
              to single copy. However, duplicate loci may survive through
              selection for increased dosage. Here, we show how the WGD
              increased copy number of some glycolytic genes could have
              conferred an almost immediate selective advantage to an ancestor
              of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, providing a rationale for the
              success of the WGD. We propose that the loss of other redundant
              genes throughout the genome resulted in incremental dosage
              increases for the surviving duplicated glycolytic genes. This
              increase gave post-WGD yeasts a growth advantage through rapid
              glucose fermentation; one of this lineage's many adaptations to
              glucose-rich environments. Our hypothesis is supported by data
              from enzyme kinetics and comparative genomics. Because changes in
              gene dosage follow directly from post-WGD deletions, dosage
              selection can confer an almost instantaneous benefit after WGD,
              unlike neofunctionalization or subfunctionalization, which
              require specific mutations. We also show theoretically that
              increased fermentative capacity is of greatest advantage when
              glucose resources are both large and dense, an observation

              has motivated vigorous development of computational approaches
              for predicting protein-protein interactions. A set of recently
              developed bioinformatics methods utilizes coevolutionary
              information of the interacting partners (e.g., as exhibited in
              the form of correlations between distance matrices, where, for
              each protein, a matrix stores the pairwise distances between the

              yeast",
  author   = "Wu, Wei-Sheng and Li, Wen-Hsiung",
  abstract = "BACKGROUND: A gene regulatory module (GRM) is a set of genes that
              is regulated by the same set of transcription factors (TFs). By
              organizing the genome into GRMs, a living cell can coordinate the
              activities of many genes in response to various internal and
              external stimuli. Therefore, identifying GRMs is helpful for
              understanding gene regulation. RESULTS: Integrating transcription
              factor binding site (TFBS), mutant, ChIP-chip, and heat shock
              time series gene expression data, we develop a method, called
              Heat-Inducible Module Identification Algorithm (HIMIA), for
              reconstructing GRMs of yeast heat shock response. Unlike previous
              module inference tools which are static statistics-based methods,
              HIMIA is a dynamic system model-based method that utilizes the
              dynamic nature of time series gene expression data. HIMIA
              identifies 29 GRMs, which in total contain 182 heat-inducible
              genes regulated by 12 heat-responsive TFs. Using various types of
              published data, we validate the biological relevance of the
              identified GRMs. Our analysis suggests that different
              combinations of a fairly small number of heat-responsive TFs
              regulate a large number of genes involved in heat shock response
              and that there may exist crosstalk between heat shock response
              and other cellular processes. Using HIMIA, we identify 68
              uncharacterized genes that may be involved in heat shock response
              and we also identify their plausible heat-responsive regulators.
              Furthermore, HIMIA is capable of assigning the regulatory roles
              of the TFs that regulate GRMs and Cst6, Hsf1, Msn2, Msn4, and
              Yap1 are found to be activators of several GRMs. In addition,
              HIMIA refines two clusters of genes involved in heat shock
              response and provides a better understanding of how the complex
              expression program of heat shock response is regulated. Finally,
              we show that HIMIA outperforms four current module inference
              tools (GRAM, MOFA, ReMoDisvovery, and SAMBA), and we conduct two
              randomization tests to show that the output of HIMIA is
              statistically meaningful. CONCLUSION: HIMIA is effective for
              reconstructing GRMs of yeast heat shock response. Indeed, many of
              the reconstructed GRMs are in agreement with previous studies.
              Further, HIMIA predicts several interesting new modules and novel
              TF combinations. Our study shows that integrating multiple types
              of data is a powerful approach to studying complex biological
              systems.",

              a theory for optimal metabolic enzyme activity when cells are
              selected for maximal growth-rate given such growth-limiting
              biochemical constraints. We show how optimal enzyme levels can be
              understood to result from an enzyme benefit minus cost
              optimization. The constraints we consider originate from
              different biochemical aspects of microbial growth, such as
              competition for limiting amounts of ribosomes or RNA polymerases,
              or limitations in available energy. Enzyme benefit is related to
              its kinetics and its importance for fitness, while enzyme cost
              expresses to what extent resource consumption reduces fitness
              through constraint-induced reductions of other enzyme levels. A
              metabolic fitness landscape is introduced to define the fitness
              potential of an enzyme. This concept is related to the selection

              ethanol formation. Part is metabolized oxidatively and part
              reductively, with ethanol being the end product of reductive
              energy metabolism. The corresponding metabolic state is
              designated oxidoreductive. Ethanol can be used oxidatively only.
              Maximum rates of oxidative glucose and ethanol degradation are
              governed by the respiratory capacity of the cells. The model is
              formulated by using the stoichiometric growth equations for pure
              oxidative and reductive (fermentative) glucose and ethanol
              metabolism. Together with the experimentally determinable yield
              coefficients (Y(X/S)) for the respective metabolic pathways, the
              resulting equation system is sufficiently determined. The
              superiority of the presented model over hitherto published ones

               leiomyomatosis and renal-cell cancer (HLRCC). It has previously

               describe microbial growth using a few measurable parameters that
               capture the essence of this complex phenomenon. Two key events
               at the cell membrane-extracellular glucose sensing and
               uptake-initiate the budding yeast's growth on glucose. However,
               conventional growth models focus almost exclusively on glucose
               uptake. Here we present results from growth-rate experiments
               that cannot be explained by focusing on glucose uptake alone. By
               imposing a glucose uptake rate independent of the sensed
               extracellular glucose level, we show that despite increasing
               both the sensed glucose concentration and uptake rate, the
               cell's growth rate can decrease or even approach zero. We
               resolve this puzzle by showing that the interaction between
               glucose perception and import, not their individual actions,
               determines the central features of growth, and characterize this
               interaction using a quantitative model. Disrupting this
               interaction by knocking out two key glucose sensors
               significantly changes the cell's growth rate, yet uptake rates
               are unchanged. This is due to a decrease in burden that glucose
               perception places on the cells. Our work shows that glucose
               perception and import are separate and pivotal modules of yeast

              signaling pathway initiated by glycolysis inhibition that results
              in sensitization to death receptor (DR)-induced apoptosis. We
              showed, in several human cancer cell lines (such as Jurkat, HeLa,

              induced by Fas or by tumor necrosis factor-related
              apoptosis-inducing ligand. This sensitization is controlled
              through the adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein
              kinase (AMPK), which is the central energy-sensing system of the
              cell. We established the fact that AMPK is activated upon

              (mTOR) inhibition leading to Mcl-1 decrease, but no other Bcl-2

              levels neither through transcriptional nor through
              posttranslational mechanism but rather by controlling its
              translation. Therefore, our results show a novel mechanism for
              the sensitization to DR-induced apoptosis linking glucose
              metabolism to Mcl-1 downexpression. In addition, this study
              provides a rationale for the combined use of DR ligands with AMPK

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Pseudomonas syringae pv tomato DC3000 (DC3000) is a
              Gram-negative model plant pathogen that is found in a wide
              variety of environments. To survive in these diverse conditions
              it must sense and respond to various environmental cues. One
              micronutrient required for most forms of life is iron.
              Bioavailable iron has been shown to be an important global
              regulator for many bacteria where it not only regulates a wide
              variety of genes involved in general cell physiology but also
              virulence determinants. In this study we used microarrays to
              study differential gene regulation in DC3000 in response to
              changes in levels of cell-associated iron. RESULTS: DC3000
              cultures were grown under highly controlled conditions and
              analyzed after the addition of iron citrate or sodium citrate to
              the media. In the cultures supplemented with iron, we found that
              cell-associated iron increased rapidly while culture densities
              were not significantly different over 4 hours when compared to
              cultures with sodium citrate added. Microarray analysis of
              samples taken from before and after the addition of either sodium
              citrate or iron citrate identified 386 differentially regulated
              genes with high statistical confidence. Differentially regulated
              genes were clustered based on expression patterns observed
              between comparison of samples taken at different time points and
              with different supplements. This analysis grouped genes
              associated with the same regulatory motifs and/or had similar
              putative or known function. CONCLUSION: This study shows iron is
              rapidly taken up from the medium by iron-depleted DC3000 cultures
              and that bioavailable iron is a global cue for the expression of
              iron transport, storage, and known virulence factors in DC3000.
              Furthermore approximately 34\% of the differentially regulated
              genes are associated with one of four regulatory motifs for Fur,
              PvdS, HrpL, or RpoD.",

              basic cellular processes. Until recently, our biochemical
              understanding of protein phosphorylation on a global scale has
              been extremely limited; only one half of the yeast kinases have
              known in vivo substrates and the phosphorylating kinase is known
              for less than 160 phosphoproteins. Here we describe, with the use
              of proteome chip technology, the in vitro substrates recognized
              by most yeast protein kinases: we identified over 4,000
              phosphorylation events involving 1,325 different proteins. These
              substrates represent a broad spectrum of different biochemical
              functions and cellular roles. Distinct sets of substrates were
              recognized by each protein kinase, including closely related
              kinases of the protein kinase A family and four cyclin-dependent
              kinases that vary only in their cyclin subunits. Although many
              substrates reside in the same cellular compartment or belong to
              the same functional category as their phosphorylating kinase,
              many others do not, indicating possible new roles for several
              kinases. Furthermore, integration of the phosphorylation results
              with protein-protein interaction and transcription factor binding
              data revealed novel regulatory modules. Our phosphorylation
              results have been assembled into a first-generation
              phosphorylation map for yeast. Because many yeast proteins and
              pathways are conserved, these results will provide insights into
              the mechanisms and roles of protein phosphorylation in many

              growing Saccharomyces cerevisiae. mRNAs were separated by
              velocity sedimentation on a sucrose gradient, and 14 fractions
              across the gradient were analyzed by quantitative microarray
              analysis, providing a profile of ribosome association with mRNAs
              for thousands of genes. For most genes, the majority of mRNA
              molecules were associated with ribosomes and presumably engaged
              in translation. This systematic approach enabled us to recognize
              genes with unusual behavior. For 43 genes, most mRNA molecules
              were not associated with ribosomes, suggesting that they may be
              translationally controlled. For 53 genes, including GCN4, CPA1,
              and ICY2, three genes for which translational control is known to
              play a key role in regulation, most mRNA molecules were
              associated with a single ribosome. The number of ribosomes
              associated with mRNAs increased with increasing length of the
              putative protein-coding sequence, consistent with longer transit

              density at which ribosomes were distributed on each mRNA (i.e.,
              the number of ribosomes per unit ORF length) was well below the

              initiation as the rate-limiting step in translation. Global

  abstract = "Although several studies have provided important insights into
              the general principles of biological networks, the link between
              network organization and the genome-scale dynamics of the
              underlying entities (genes, mRNAs, and proteins) and its role in
              systems behavior remain unclear. Here we show that transcription
              factor (TF) dynamics and regulatory network organization are
              tightly linked. By classifying TFs in the yeast regulatory
              network into three hierarchical layers (top, core, and bottom)
              and integrating diverse genome-scale datasets, we find that the
              TFs have static and dynamic properties that are similar within a
              layer and different across layers. At the protein level, the
              top-layer TFs are relatively abundant, long-lived, and noisy
              compared with the core- and bottom-layer TFs. Although
              variability in expression of top-layer TFs might confer a
              selective advantage, as this permits at least some members in a
              clonal cell population to initiate a response to changing
              conditions, tight regulation of the core- and bottom-layer TFs
              may minimize noise propagation and ensure fidelity in regulation.
              We propose that the interplay between network organization and TF
              dynamics could permit differential utilization of the same
              underlying network by distinct members of a clonal cell

               20,000 generations. Such clock-like regularity is usually viewed
               as the signature of neutral evolution, but several lines of
               evidence indicate that almost all of these mutations were
               beneficial. This same population later evolved an elevated

              degree of aneuploidy",
  author   = "Duesberg, P and Rausch, C and Rasnick, D and Hehlmann, R",
  abstract = "Genetic and phenotypic instability are hallmarks of cancer cells,
              but their cause is not clear. The leading hypothesis suggests
              that a poorly defined gene mutation generates genetic instability
              and that some of many subsequent mutations then cause cancer.
              Here we investigate the hypothesis that genetic instability of
              cancer cells is caused by aneuploidy, an abnormal balance of
              chromosomes. Because symmetrical segregation of chromosomes
              depends on exactly two copies of mitosis genes, aneuploidy
              involving chromosomes with mitosis genes will destabilize the
              karyotype. The hypothesis predicts that the degree of genetic
              instability should be proportional to the degree of aneuploidy.
              Thus it should be difficult, if not impossible, to maintain the
              particular karyotype of a highly aneuploid cancer cell on clonal
              propagation. This prediction was confirmed with clonal cultures
              of chemically transformed, aneuploid Chinese hamster embryo
              cells. It was found that the higher the ploidy factor of a clone,
              the more unstable was its karyotype. The ploidy factor is the
              quotient of the modal chromosome number divided by the normal
              number of the species. Transformed Chinese hamster embryo cells
              with a ploidy factor of 1.7 were estimated to change their
              karyotype at a rate of about 3\% per generation, compared with
              1.8\% for cells with a ploidy factor of 0.95. Because the
              background noise of karyotyping is relatively high, the cells
              with low ploidy factor may be more stable than our method
              suggests. The karyotype instability of human colon cancer cell
              lines, recently analyzed by Lengnauer et al. [Lengnauer, C.,
              Kinzler, K. W. \& Vogelstein, B. (1997) Nature (London) 386,
              623-627], also corresponds exactly to their degree of aneuploidy.
              We conclude that aneuploidy is sufficient to explain genetic
              instability and the resulting karyotypic and phenotypic
              heterogeneity of cancer cells, independent of gene mutation.
              Because aneuploidy has also been proposed to cause cancer, our
              hypothesis offers a common, unique mechanism of altering and
              simultaneously destabilizing normal cellular phenotypes.",

  abstract = "The pervasive influence of resident microorganisms on the
              phenotype of their hosts is exemplified by the intracellular
              bacterium Buchnera aphidicola, which provides its aphid partner
              with essential amino acids (EAAs). We investigated variation in
              the dietary requirement for EAAs among four pea aphid
              (Acyrthosiphon pisum) clones. Buchnera-derived nitrogen
              contributed to the synthesis of all EAAs for which aphid clones
              required a dietary supply, and to none of the EAAs for which all
              four clones had no dietary requirement, suggesting that low total
              dietary nitrogen may select for reduced synthesis of certain EAAs
              in some aphid clones. The sequenced Buchnera genomes showed that
              the EAA nutritional phenotype (i.e. the profile of dietary EAAs
              required by the aphid) cannot be attributed to sequence variation
              of Buchnera genes coding EAA biosynthetic enzymes. Metabolic
              modelling by flux balance analysis demonstrated that EAA output
              from Buchnera can be determined precisely by the flux of host
              metabolic precursors to Buchnera. Specifically, the four EAA
              nutritional phenotypes could be reproduced by metabolic models
              with unique profiles of host inputs, dominated by variation in
              supply of aspartate, homocysteine and glutamate. This suggests
              that the nutritional phenotype of the symbiosis is determined
              principally by host metabolism and transporter genes that
              regulate nutrient supply to Buchnera. Intraspecific variation in
              the nutritional phenotype of symbioses is expected to mediate
              partitioning of plant resources among aphid genotypes,
              potentially promoting the genetic subdivision of aphid
              populations. In this way, microbial symbioses may play an

  abstract = "In the present work dynamic changes of free intracellular amino
              acid pools during autonomous oscillations of Saccharomyces
              cerevisiae were quantified in glucose-limited continuous
              cultivations. At a dilution rate of D = 0.22 h(-1) cyclic changes
              with a period of 120 min were found for many variables such as
              carbon dioxide production rate, dissolved oxygen, pH, biomass
              content, and various metabolite concentrations. On the basis of
              the observed dynamic patterns, free intracellular amino acids
              were classified to show oscillatory, stationary, or chaotic
              behavior. Amino acid pools such as serine, alanine, valine,
              leucine, or lysine were subjected to clear oscillations with a
              frequency of 120 min, identical to that of other described
              cultivation variables, indicating that there is a direct
              correlation between the periodic changes of amino acid
              concentrations and the metabolic oscillations on the cellular
              level. The oscillations of these amino acids were unequally
              phase-delayed and had different amplitudes of oscillation.
              Accordingly, they exhibited different patterns in phase plane
              plots vs. intracellular trehalose. Despite the complex and marked
              metabolic changes during oscillation, selected intracellular
              amino acids such as histidine, threonine, isoleucine, or arginine
              remained about constant. Concentrations of glutamate and
              glutamine showed a chaotic behavior. However, the ratio of
              glutamate to glutamine concentration was found to be oscillatory,
              with a period of 60 min and a corresponding figure eight-shaped
              pattern in a plot vs. trehalose concentration. Considering the
              described diversity, it can be concluded that the observed
              periodic changes are neither just the consequence of low or high
              rates of protein biosynthesis/degradation nor correlated to
              changing cell volumes during oscillation. The ratio between
              doubling time (189 min) and period of oscillation of
              intracellular amino acids (120 min) was 1:6. The fact that there
              is a close relationship between doubling time and period of
              oscillation underlines that the described autonomous oscillations
              are cell-cycle-associated.",

              reconstruction of genome-scale networks for a number of key
              organisms. The application of physicochemical constraints to
              these stoichiometric networks allows researchers, through methods
              such as flux balance analysis, to highlight key sets of reactions
              necessary to achieve particular objectives. The key benefits of
              constraint-based analysis lie in the minimal knowledge required
              to infer systemic properties. However, network degeneracy leads
              to a large number of flux distributions that satisfy any
              objective; moreover, these distributions may be dominated by
              biologically irrelevant internal cycles. By examining the
              geometry underlying the problem, we define two methods for
              finding a unique solution within the space of all possible flux
              distributions; such a solution contains no internal cycles, and
              is representative of the space as a whole. The first method draws
              on typical geometric knowledge, but cannot be applied to large
              networks because of the high computational complexity of the
              problem. Thus a second method, an iteration of linear programs
              which scales easily to the genome scale, is defined. The
              algorithm is run on four recent genome-scale models, and unique
              flux solutions are found. The algorithm set out here will allow
              researchers in flux balance analysis to exchange typical
              solutions to their models in a reproducible format. Moreover,

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Prior to cluster analysis or genetic network analysis
              it is customary to filter, or remove genes considered to be
              irrelevant from the set of genes to be analyzed. Often genes
              whose variation across samples is less than an arbitrary
              threshold value are deleted. This can improve interpretability
              and reduce bias. RESULTS: This paper introduces modular models
              for representing network structure in order to study the relative
              effects of different filtering methods. We show that cluster
              analysis and principal components are strongly affected by
              filtering. Filtering methods intended specifically for cluster
              and network analysis are introduced and compared by simulating
              modular networks with known statistical properties. To study more
              realistic situations, we analyze simulated {"}real{"} data based
              on well-characterized E. coli and S. cerevisiae regulatory

              dispensability reflects insignificance of the ancestral function

               and mental performance and to protect against stress. We, and
               others, have reported that R. rosea can extend lifespan in
               flies, worms, and yeast. However, its molecular mechanism is
               currently unknown. Here, we tested whether R. rosea might act
               through a pathway related to dietary restriction (DR) that can
               extend lifespan in a range of model organisms. While the
               mechanism of DR itself is also unknown, three molecular pathways
               have been associated with it: the silent information regulator 2
               (SIR2) proteins, insulin and insulin-like growth factor
               signaling (IIS), and the target of rapamycin (TOR). In flies, DR
               is implemented through a reduction in dietary yeast content. We
               found that R. rosea extract extended lifespan in both sexes
               independent of the yeast content in the diet. We also found that
               the extract extended lifespan when the SIR2, IIS, or TOR
               pathways were genetically perturbed. Upon examination of water
               and fat content, we found that R. rosea decreased water content
               and elevated fat content in both sexes, but did not sensitize
               flies to desiccation or protect them against starvation. There
               were some sex-specific differences in response to R. rosea . In
               female flies, the expression levels of glycolytic genes and
               dSir2 were down-regulated, and NADH levels were decreased. In
               males however, R. rosea provided no protection against heat
               stress and had no effect on the major heat shock protein HSP70
               and actually down-regulated the mitochondrial HSP22. Our
               findings largely rule out an elevated general resistance to
               stress and DR-related pathways as mechanistic candidates. The
               latter conclusion is especially relevant given the limited
               potential for DR to improve human health and lifespan, and
               presents R. rosea as a potential viable candidate to treat aging
               and age-related diseases in humans.",

              molecular targets of OGT that are important for its cell cycle
              functions are unknown. Here, we identify 141 previously unknown
              O-GlcNAc sites on proteins that function in spindle assembly and
              cytokinesis. Many of these O-GlcNAcylation sites are either
              identical to known phosphorylation sites or in close proximity to
              them. Furthermore, we found that O-GlcNAcylation altered the

              reduction in the transcript for the CDK1 phosphatase, CDC25C. OGT

              are, what the hierarchical relationship among them is, or what

  abstract = "Domain architectures and catalytic functions of enzymes
              constitute the centerpieces of a metabolic network. These types
              of information are formulated as a two-layered network consisting
              of domains, proteins, and reactions—a domain–protein–reaction
              (DPR) network. We propose an algorithm to reconstruct the
              evolutionary history of DPR networks across multiple species and
              categorize the mechanisms of metabolic systems evolution in terms
              of network changes. The reconstructed history reveals distinct
              patterns of evolutionary mechanisms between prokaryotic and
              eukaryotic networks. Although the evolutionary mechanisms in
              early ancestors of prokaryotes and eukaryotes are quite similar,
              more novel and duplicated domain compositions with identical
              catalytic functions arise along the eukaryotic lineage. In
              contrast, prokaryotic enzymes become more versatile by catalyzing
              multiple reactions with similar chemical operations. Moreover,
              different metabolic pathways are enriched with distinct network
              evolution mechanisms. For instance, although the pathways of
              steroid biosynthesis, protein kinases, and glycosaminoglycan
              biosynthesis all constitute prominent features of animal-specific
              physiology, their evolution of domain architectures and catalytic
              functions follows distinct patterns. Steroid biosynthesis is
              enriched with reaction creations but retains a relatively
              conserved repertoire of domain compositions and proteins. Protein
              kinases retain conserved reactions but possess many novel domains
              and proteins. In contrast, glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis has
              high rates of reaction/protein creations and domain recruitments.
              Finally, we elicit and validate two general principles underlying
              the evolution of DPR networks: 1) duplicated enzyme proteins
              possess similar catalytic functions and 2) the majority of novel
              domains arise to catalyze novel reactions. These results shed new
              lights on the evolution of metabolic systems.",

              cycles during continuous growth under nutrient-limiting
              conditions. Previous studies revealed periodic fluctuations of
              aminolevulinic acid, a precursor of heme, indicating that heme
              biosynthesis is temporally regulated during these metabolic
              cycles. The enzyme that catabolizes heme, heme oxygenase, was
              found to be expressed in a highly periodic manner at both the
              mRNA and protein level. Heme oxygenase generates the biological
              gas, carbon monoxide (CO), as a product of heme catabolism. It is
              shown that pulsed administration of CO induces a phase
              advancement into the oxidative, respiratory phase of the
              metabolic cycles. This CO-mediated phase advancement takes place
              only if the gas is administered during the temporal window when
              it is predicted to be generated. It is further shown that a yeast
              strain bearing a targeted deletion of the gene encoding heme
              oxygenase displays protracted metabolic cycles. These

              has formed the basis for discussing evolution and speciation for
              more than 60 years. However, this metaphor, with its emphasis on
              adaptive peaks and valleys, is to a large degree a reflection of
              our three-dimensional experience. Both genotypes and phenotypes
              of biological organisms differ in numerous characteristics, and,
              thus, the dimension of ‘real’ adaptive landscapes is much larger
              than three. Properties of multidimensional adaptive landscapes
              are very different from those of low dimension. Consequently,
              something that is seen as a theoretical challenge in a
              low-dimensional case might be a trivial problem in a
              multidimensional context and vice versa. In particular, the
              problem of how a population crosses an adaptive valley on its way
              from one adaptive peak to another, which Wright attempted to
              solve with his shifting balance theory, may be non-existent. A
              new framework is emerging for deepening our understanding of
              evolution and speciation, which provides a plausible

              model of a quantitative genetic character under stabilizing
              selection. Epistasis is introduced by a simple multiplicative
              term in the function that maps gene effects onto genotypic
              values. In the model with only additive effects on the trait, the
              probability of a peak shift and the amount of reproductive
              isolation are always inversely related, i.e., the higher the peak
              shift rate, the lower the amount of reproductive isolation caused
              by the peak shift. With epistatic characters there is no
              consistent relationship between these two values. Interestingly,
              there are cases where both transition rates as well as the amount
              of reproductive isolation are increased relative to the additive
              model. This effect has two main causes: a shift in the location
              of the transition point, and the hybrids between the two
              alternative optimal genotypes have lower average fitness in the
              epistatic case. A review of the empirical literature shows that
              the fitness relations resulting in higher peak shift rates and
              more reproductive isolation are qualitatively the same as those

  abstract = "Changes in gene expression have been proposed to underlie many,
              or even most, adaptive differences between species. Despite the
              increasing acceptance of this view, only a handful of cases of
              adaptive gene expression evolution have been demonstrated. To
              address this discrepancy, we introduce a simple test for
              lineage-specific selection on gene expression. Applying the test
              to genome-wide gene expression data from the budding yeast
              Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we find that hundreds of gene
              expression levels have been subject to lineage-specific
              selection. Comparing these findings with independent population
              genetic evidence of selective sweeps suggests that this
              lineage-specific selection has resulted in recent sweeps at over
              a hundred genes, most of which led to increased transcript
              levels. Examination of the implicated genes revealed a specific
              biochemical pathway--ergosterol biosynthesis--where the
              expression of multiple genes has been subject to selection for
              reduced levels. In sum, these results suggest that adaptive
              evolution of gene expression is common in yeast, that regulatory
              adaptation can occur at the level of entire pathways, and that
              similar genome-wide scans may be possible in other species,

              breaks them up. The mutational deterministic hypothesis (MDH)

               obscure. A sizable fraction of amino-acid substitutions seem to
               be fixed by positive selection, but it is unclear to what degree
               long-term protein evolution is constrained by epistasis, that
               is, instances when substitutions that are accepted in one
               genotype are deleterious in another. Here we obtain a
               quantitative estimate of the prevalence of epistasis in
               long-term protein evolution by relating data on amino-acid usage
               in 14 organelle proteins and 2 nuclear-encoded proteins to their
               rates of short-term evolution. We studied multiple alignments of
               at least 1,000 orthologues for each of these 16 proteins from
               species from a diverse phylogenetic background and found that an
               average site contained approximately eight different amino
               acids. Thus, without epistasis an average site should accept
               two-fifths of all possible amino acids, and the average rate of
               amino-acid substitutions should therefore be about three-fifths
               lower than the rate of neutral evolution. However, we found that
               the measured rate of amino-acid substitution in recent evolution
               is 20 times lower than the rate of neutral evolution and an
               order of magnitude lower than that expected in the absence of
               epistasis. These data indicate that epistasis is pervasive
               throughout protein evolution: about 90 per cent of all
               amino-acid substitutions have a neutral or beneficial impact
               only in the genetic backgrounds in which they occur, and must
               therefore be deleterious in a different background of other
               species. Our findings show that most amino-acid substitutions
               have different fitness effects in different species and that
               epistasis provides the primary conceptual framework to describe
               the tempo and mode of long-term protein evolution.",

               current COBRA methods is the possible violation of the loop law
               in the computed steady-state flux solutions. The loop law is
               analogous to Kirchhoff's second law for electric circuits, and
               states that at steady state there can be no net flux around a
               closed network cycle. Although the consequences of the loop law

               changes in enzyme expression levels. The size of the ensemble is

              extracellular acetate and pyruvate in the same culture. Of the

              3-phosphoglycerate, and phosphoenolpyruvate show the most
              pronounced oscillatory behavior, the latter three compounds
              oscillating out of phase with the former. This agrees with
              previously observed metabolic control by phosphofructokinase and
              pyruvate kinase. Although individually not clearly oscillating,
              several intermediates of the TCA cycle, i.e.,
              alpha-ketoglutarate, succinate, fumarate, and malate, exhibited
              increasing concentration during the cell cycle phase with high

              Together with the observed close correlation of the pool sizes of
              the involved metabolites, this might indicate that, in vivo,
              these reactions are operating close to equilibrium, whereby care
              must be taken due to possible differences between in vivo and in
              vitro conditions. Combining the data with previously determined
              intracellular amino acid levels from the same culture, a few
              clear correlations between catabolism and anabolism could be
              identified: phosphoglycerate/serine and

              consequences caused by mutation of one gene depend on one or more
              mutations at another gene. Epistasis is critical for
              understanding many genetic and evolutionary processes, including
              pathway organization, evolution of sexual reproduction,
              mutational load, ploidy, genomic complexity, speciation, and the
              origin of life. Nevertheless, current understandings for the
              genome-wide distribution of epistasis are mostly inferred from
              interactions among one mutant type per gene, whereas how
              epistatic interaction partners change dynamically for different
              mutant alleles of the same gene is largely unknown. Here we
              address this issue by combining predictions from flux balance
              analysis and data from a recently published high-throughput
              experiment. Our results show that different alleles can
              epistatically interact with very different gene sets.
              Furthermore, between two random mutant alleles of the same gene,
              the chance for the allele with more severe mutational consequence
              to develop a higher percentage of negative epistasis than the
              other allele is 50∼70\% in eukaryotic organisms, but only 20∼30\%
              in bacteria and archaea. We developed a population genetics model
              that predicts that the observed distribution for the sign of
              epistasis can speed up the process of purging deleterious
              mutations in eukaryotic organisms. Our results indicate that
              epistasis among genes can be dynamically rewired at the genome
              level, and call on future efforts to revisit theories that can
              integrate epistatic dynamics among genes in biological systems.",

              been reported in vitro. Rather, experimental studies have
              generally invoked fixed subcellular heterogeneities in
              calcium-cycling characteristics as the mechanism of subcellular
              alternans formation. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we have
              generalized the previously proposed dynamical mechanism to
              predict a simple pacing algorithm by which subcellular alternans
              can be induced in isolated cardiac myocytes in the presence or
              absence of fixed subcellular heterogeneity. We aimed to verify
              this hypothesis using computational modeling and to confirm it
              experimentally in isolated cardiac myocytes. Furthermore, we
              hypothesized that this dynamical mechanism may account for
              previous reports of subcellular alternans seen in statically
              paced, intact tissue. METHODS AND RESULTS: Using a
              physiologically realistic computational model of a cardiac
              myocyte, we show that our predicted pacing algorithm induces
              subcellular alternans in a manner consistent with theoretical
              predictions. We then use a combination of real-time
              electrophysiology and fluorescent calcium imaging to implement
              this protocol experimentally and show that it robustly induces
              subcellular alternans in isolated guinea pig ventricular
              myocytes. Finally, we use computational modeling to demonstrate
              that subcellular alternans can indeed be dynamically induced
              during static pacing of 1D fibers of myocytes during tissue-level
              spatially discordant alternans. CONCLUSION: Here we provide the
              first direct experimental evidence that subcellular alternans can
              be dynamically induced in cardiac myocytes. This proposed
              mechanism may contribute to subcellular alternans formation in
              the intact heart.",

  abstract = "A major challenge in systems biology is to evaluate the
              feasibility of a biological research project prior to its
              realization. Since experiments are animals-, cost- and
              time-consuming, approaches allowing researchers to discriminate
              alternative hypotheses with a minimal set of experiments are
              highly desirable. Given a null hypothesis and alternative model,
              as well as laboratory constraints like observable players, sample
              size, noise level, and stimulation options, we suggest a method
              to obtain a list of required experiments in order to
              significantly reject the null hypothesis model M0 if a specified
              alternative model MA is realized. For this purpose, we estimate
              the power to detect a violation of M0 by means of Monte Carlo
              simulations. Iteratively, the power is maximized over all
              feasible stimulations of the system using multi-experiment
              fitting, leading to an optimal combination of experimental
              settings to discriminate the null hypothesis and alternative
              model. We prove the importance of simultaneous modeling of
              combined experiments with quantitative, highly sampled in vivo
              measurements from the Jak/STAT5 signaling pathway in fibroblasts,
              stimulated with erythropoietin (Epo). Afterwards we apply the
              presented iterative experimental design approach to the Jak/STAT3

              offers the possibility of deciding which scientific questions can
              be answered based on existing laboratory constraints. To be able
              to concentrate on feasible questions on account of inexpensive

  abstract = "Flux Balance Analysis (FBA) has been used in the past to analyze
              microbial metabolic networks. Typically, FBA is used to study the
              metabolic flux at a particular steady state of the system.
              However, there are many situations where the reprogramming of the
              metabolic network is important. Therefore, the dynamics of these
              metabolic networks have to be studied. In this paper, we have
              extended FBA to account for dynamics and present two different
              formulations for dynamic FBA. These two approaches were used in
              the analysis of diauxic growth in Escherichia coli. Dynamic FBA
              was used to simulate the batch growth of E. coli on glucose, and
              the predictions were found to qualitatively match experimental
              data. The dynamic FBA formalism was also used to study the
              sensitivity to the objective function. It was found that an
              instantaneous objective function resulted in better predictions
              than a terminal-type objective function. The constraints that
              govern the growth at different phases in the batch culture were
              also identified. Therefore, dynamic FBA provides a framework for
              analyzing the transience of metabolism due to metabolic
              reprogramming and for obtaining insights for the design of
              metabolic networks.",

               such as yeast, have failed to detect a large fraction of the
               loci that underlie such complex traits. A lack of statistical
               power to identify multiple loci with small effects is
               undoubtedly one of the primary reasons for this problem. We have
               developed a method in yeast that allows the use of much larger
               sample sizes than previously possible and hence permits the
               detection of multiple loci with small effects. The method
               involves generating very large numbers of progeny from a cross
               between two Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains and then
               phenotyping and genotyping pools of these offspring. We applied

               influenced by one major locus and others by at least 20 loci.
               Our results provide an empirical demonstration of the genetic

              For example, dynamic Bayesian network methods and methods that
              use the framework of finite dynamical systems, such as Boolean
              networks, all take discrete input. Experimental data, however,
              are typically continuous and represented by computer floating
              point numbers. The translation from continuous to discrete data
              is crucial in preserving the variable dependencies and thus has a
              significant impact on the performance of the network inference
              algorithms. We compare the performance of two such algorithms
              that use discrete data using several different discretization

              network framework, the other-a time-and state-discrete dynamical

              beneficial mutations. Extending earlier work, recent theory makes
              two predictions that seem to be robust to biological details: the
              distribution of fitness effects among beneficial mutations before
              selection should be (i) exponential and (ii) invariant, meaning
              it is always exponential regardless of the fitness rank of the
              wild-type allele. Here we test these predictions by assaying the
              fitness of 665 independently derived single-step mutations in the
              bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens across a range of environments.
              We show that the distribution of fitness effects among beneficial
              mutations is indistinguishable from an exponential despite marked
              variation in the fitness rank of the wild type across

              by an approximately exponential distribution with many mutations

              performed a genome-wide analysis of mutations that accumulate in
              MMR-deficient diploid lines of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. These
              lines were derived from a common ancestor and were grown for 160
              generations, with bottlenecks reducing the population to one cell
              every twenty generations. We sequenced to between eight and
              twenty-fold coverage one wild-type and three mutator lines using
              Illumina Solexa 36-bp reads. Using an experimentally aware

              occurred independently in two lines. All 48 indels, comprised of
              46 deletions and two insertions, occurred in homopolymer tracts
              (i.e., 47 poly A or T tracts, 1 poly G or C tract) between five
              and thirteen base pairs long. Our findings are of interest
              because HP tracts are present at high levels in the yeast genome
              (> 77,400 for five to twenty nt HP tracts), and frameshift
              mutations in these regions are likely to disrupt gene function.

              markedly differing effects on lifetime survival depending upon
              the dietary history of the animal. When animals are switched from
              DR feeding to ad libitum feeding with a diet supplemented with
              alpha-lipoic acid, the extended survival characteristic of DR
              feeding is maintained, even though the animals show accelerated

              non-supplemented diet, blocks the normal effect of DR to extend
              survival, even after cessation of lipoic acid supplementation.
              Unlike the dynamic effect of switching between DR and ad libitum
              feeding with a non-supplemented diet where the subsequent
              survival trajectory is determined by the new feeding regime,
              lipoic acid fixes the survival trajectory to that established by

              functional relationships between genes and pathways. For example,
              double mutants with surprisingly slow growth define synergistic
              interactions that can identify compensatory pathways or protein

              Saccharomyces cerevisiae was investigated under different
              environmental conditions using (13)C-tracer experiments.
              Real-time quantification of the volatile metabolites ethanol and
              CO(2) allowed accurate carbon balancing. In all experiments with
              the wild-type, a strong correlation between the rates of growth
              and glucose uptake was observed, indicating a constant yield of
              biomass. In contrast, glycerol and acetate production rates were
              less dependent on the rate of glucose uptake, but were affected
              by environmental conditions. The glycerol production rate was
              highest during growth in high-osmolarity medium (2.9 mmol g(-1)
              h(-1)), while the highest acetate production rate of 2.1 mmol
              g(-1) h(-1) was observed in alkaline medium of pH 6.9. Under
              standard growth conditions (25 g glucose l(-1) , pH 5.0, 30
              degrees C) S. cerevisiae had low fluxes through the pentose
              phosphate pathway and the TCA cycle. A significant increase in
              TCA cycle activity from 0.03 mmol g(-1) h(-1) to about 1.7 mmol
              g(-1) h(-1) was observed when S. cerevisiae grew more slowly as a
              result of environmental perturbations, including unfavourable pH
              values and sodium chloride stress. Compared to experiments with
              high glucose uptake rates, the ratio of CO(2) to ethanol
              increased more than 50 \%, indicating an increase in flux through
              the TCA cycle. Although glycolysis and the ethanol production
              pathway still exhibited the highest fluxes, the net flux through
              the TCA cycle increased significantly with decreasing glucose
              uptake rates. Results from experiments with single gene deletion
              mutants partially impaired in glucose repression (hxk2, grr1)
              indicated that the rate of glucose uptake correlates with this
              increase in TCA cycle flux. These findings are discussed in the
              context of regulation of glucose repression.",

              photodiodes (PSAPD). The charge output is amplified and read
              using NOVA RENA-3 ASICs. This paper shows that the coincidence
              timing resolution of the RENA-3 ASIC can be improved using
              certain list-mode calibrations. We treat the calibration problem
              as a convex optimization problem and use the RENA-3s analog-based
              timing system to correct the measured data for time dispersion
              effects from correlated noise, PSAPD signal delays and varying
              signal amplitudes. The direct solution to the optimization
              problem involves a matrix inversion that grows order (n3) with
              the number of parameters. An iterative method using
              single-coordinate descent to approximate the inversion grows

              the driving forces that lead to expression divergence in some
              genes and conserved expression in others? Here we employ flux
              balance analysis to address this question for metabolic genes. We
              consider the genome-scale metabolic model of Saccharomyces

              distributions. We show that this space reveals underlying

              the conservation of the underlying gene sequences. Genes that
              have a high range of optimal flux levels tend to display
              divergent expression levels among different yeast strains and
              species. This suggests that gene regulation has diverged in those
              parts of the metabolic network that are less constrained. In

              sequences. This supports the possibility that there is less

  author   = "Wagner, Gunter P and Altenberg, Lee",
  abstract = "e problem of complex adaptations is studied in two largely
              disconnected research traditions: evolutionary biology and
              evolutionary computer science. This paper summarizes the results
              from both areas and compares their implications. In evolutionary
              computer science it was found that the Darwinian process of
              mutation, recombination and selection is not universally
              effective in improving complex systems like computer programs or
              chip designs. For adaptation to occur, these systems must possess
              {"}evolvability,{"} i.e., the ability of random variations to
              sometimes produce improvement. It was found that evolvability
              critically depends on the way genetic variation maps onto
              phenotypic variation, an issue known as the representation
              problem. The genotype-phenotype map determines the variability of
              characters, which is the propensity to vary. Variability needs to
              be distinguished from variations, which are the actually realized
              differences between individuals. The genotype-phenotype map is
              the common theme underlying such varied biological phenomena as
              genetic canalization, developmental constraints, biological
              versatility, devel- opmental dissociability, and morphological
              integration. For evolutionary biology the representation problem
              has im- portant implications: how is it that extant species
              acquired a genotype-phenotype map which allows improvement by
              mutation and selection? Is the genotype-phenotype map able to
              change in evolution? What are the selective forces, if any, that
              shape the genotype-phenotype map? We propose that the
              genotype-phenotype map can evolve by two main routes: epistatic
              mutations, or the creation of new genes. A common result for
              organismic design is modularity. By modularity we mean a
              genotype-phenotype map in which there are few pleiotropic effects
              among characters serving different functions, with pleiotropic
              effects falling mainly among characters that are part of a single
              functional complex. Such a design is expected to improve
              evolvability by limiting the interference between the adaptation
              of different functions. Several population genetic models are
              reviewed that are intended to explain the evolutionary origin of
              a modular design. While our current knowledge is insufficient to
              assess the plausibility of these models, they form the beginning
              of a framework for understanding the evolution of the

              Using periodicity and correlation algorithms, we identified 800
              genes that meet an objective minimum criterion for cell cycle
              regulation. In separate experiments, designed to examine the
              effects of inducing either the G1 cyclin Cln3p or the B-type
              cyclin Clb2p, we found that the mRNA levels of more than half of
              these 800 genes respond to one or both of these cyclins.
              Furthermore, we analyzed our set of cell cycle-regulated genes
              for known and new promoter elements and show that several known
              elements (or variations thereof) contain information predictive
              of cell cycle regulation. A full description and complete data

  abstract = "Studies on various model systems have shown that a relatively
              small number of transcription factors can set up strikingly
              complex spatial and temporal patterns of gene expression. This is
              achieved mainly by means of combinatorial or differential gene
              regulation, i.e. regulation of a gene by two or more
              transcription factors simultaneously or under different
              conditions. While a number of specific molecular details of the
              mechanisms of combinatorial regulation have emerged, our
              understanding of the general principles of combinatorial
              regulation on a genomic scale is still limited. In this work, we
              approach this problem by using the largest assembled
              transcriptional regulatory network for yeast. A specific network
              transformation procedure was used to obtain the co-regulatory
              network describing the set of all significant associations among
              transcription factors in regulating common target genes. Analysis
              of the global properties of the co-regulatory network suggested
              the presence of two classes of regulatory hubs: (i) those that
              make many co-regulatory associations, thus serving as integrators
              of disparate cellular processes; and (ii) those that make few
              co-regulatory associations, and thereby specifically regulate one
              or a few major cellular processes. Investigation of the local
              structure of the co-regulatory network revealed a significantly
              higher than expected modular organization, which might have
              emerged as a result of selection by functional constraints. These
              constraints probably emerge from the need for extensive modular
              backup and the requirement to integrate transcriptional inputs of
              multiple distinct functional systems. We then explored the
              transcriptional control of three major regulatory systems
              (ubiquitin signaling, protein kinase and transcriptional
              regulation systems) to understand specific aspects of their
              upstream control. As a result, we observed that ubiquitin E3
              ligases are regulated primarily by unique transcription factors,
              whereas E1 and E2 enzymes share common transcription factors to a
              much greater extent. This suggested that the deployment of E3s
              unique to specific functional contexts may be mediated
              significantly at the transcriptional level. Likewise, we were
              able to uncover evidence for much higher upstream transcription
              control of transcription factors themselves, in comparison to
              components of other regulatory systems. We believe that the
              results presented here might provide a framework for testing the
              role of co-regulatory associations in eukaryotic transcriptional
              control.",

              regulation or other pathways relevant to cancer. To evaluate this
              hypothesis, we conducted a genetic and epigenetic association
              study, as well as a transcriptional profiling array and a
              pathway-based network analysis. We report significant
              correlations between single nucleotide polymorphisms associated
              with the central circadian regulator CLOCK and breast cancer
              risk, with apparent effect modification by estrogen
              receptor/progesterone receptor status. We also found that
              hypermethylation in the CLOCK promoter reduced the risk of breast
              cancer, and lower levels of CLOCK expression were documented in
              healthy controls relative to normal or tumor tissue from patients
              with breast cancer. Finally, we silenced CLOCK in vitro and
              performed a whole-genome expression microarray and pathway
              analysis, which identified a cancer-relevant network of

              {13C} flux analysis",
  author   = "Frick, Oliver and Wittmann, Christoph",
  abstract = "BACKGROUND: One of the most fascinating properties of the
              biotechnologically important organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae is
              its ability to perform simultaneous respiration and fermentation
              at high growth rate even under fully aerobic conditions. In the
              present work, this Crabtree effect called phenomenon was
              investigated in detail by comparative 13C metabolic flux analysis
              of S. cerevisiae growing under purely oxidative,
              respiro-fermentative and predominantly fermentative conditions.
              RESULTS: The metabolic shift from oxidative to fermentative
              growth was accompanied by complex changes of carbon flux
              throughout the whole central metabolism. This involved a flux
              redirection from the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) towards
              glycolysis, an increased flux through pyruvate carboxylase, the
              fermentative pathways and malic enzyme, a flux decrease through
              the TCA cycle, and a partial relocation of alanine biosynthesis
              from the mitochondrion to the cytosol. S. cerevisiae exhibited a
              by-pass of pyruvate dehydrogenase in all physiological regimes.
              During oxidative growth this by-pass was mainly provided via
              pyruvate decarboxylase, acetaldehyde dehydrogenase, acetyl-CoA
              synthase and transport of acetyl-CoA into the mitochondrion.
              During fermentative growth this route, however, was saturated due
              to limited enzyme capacity. Under these conditions the cells
              exhibited high carbon flux through a chain of reactions involving
              pyruvate carboxylase, the oxaloacetate transporter and malic
              enzyme. During purely oxidative growth the PPP alone was
              sufficient to completely supply NADPH for anabolism. During
              fermentation, it provided only 60 \% of the required NADPH.
              CONCLUSION: We conclude that, in order to overcome the limited
              capacity of pyruvate dehydrogenase, S. cerevisiae possesses
              different metabolic by-passes to channel carbon into the
              mitochondrion. This involves the conversion of cytosolic pyruvate
              either into acetyl CoA or oxaloacetate followed by
              intercompartmental transport of these metabolites. During
              oxidative growth mainly the NAD specific isoforms of acetaldehyde
              dehydrogenase and isocitrate dehydrogenase catalyze the
              corresponding reactions in S. cerevisiae, whereas NADPH supply
              under fermentative conditions involves significant contribution
              of sources other than the PPP such as e. g. NADPH specific
              acetaldehyde dehydrogenase or isocitrate dehydrogenase.",

  abstract = "As genome-scale metabolic reconstructions emerge, tools to manage
              their size and complexity will be increasingly important. Flux
              balance analysis (FBA) is a constraint-based approach widely used
              to study the metabolic capabilities of cellular or subcellular
              systems. FBA problems are highly underdetermined and many
              different phenotypes can satisfy any set of constraints through
              which the metabolic system is represented. Two of the main
              concerns in FBA are exploring the space of solutions for a given
              metabolic network and finding a specific phenotype which is
              representative for a given task such as maximal growth rate.
              Here, we introduce a recursive algorithm suitable for overcoming
              both of these concerns. The method proposed is able to find the
              alternate optimal patterns of active reactions of an FBA problem
              and identify the minimal subnetwork able to perform a specific
              task as optimally as the whole. Our method represents an
              alternative to and an extension of other approaches conceived for
              exploring the space of solutions of an FBA problem. It may also
              be particularly helpful in defining a scaffold of reactions upon
              which to build up a dynamic model, when the important pathways of
              the system have not yet been well-defined.",

              its gene content. Can the reverse also be done? Here we consider
              this issue by modelling evolution of the reduced genomes of
              endosymbiotic bacteria. The diversity of gene content in these
              bacteria may reflect both variation in selective forces and
              contingency-dependent loss of alternative pathways. Using an in
              silico representation of the metabolic network of Escherichia
              coli, we examine the role of contingency by repeatedly simulating
              the successive loss of genes while controlling for the
              environment. The minimal networks that result are variable in
              both gene content and number. Partially different metabolisms can
              thus evolve owing to contingency alone. The simulation outcomes
              do preserve a core metabolism, however, which is over-represented
              in strict intracellular bacteria. Moreover, differences between
              minimal networks based on lifestyle are predictable: by
              simulating their respective environmental conditions, we can
              model evolution of the gene content in Buchnera aphidicola and
              Wigglesworthia glossinidia with over 80\% accuracy. We conclude
              that, at least for the particular cases considered here, gene
              content of an organism can be predicted with knowledge of its
              distant ancestors and its current lifestyle.",

  abstract = "Different cell types could respond to the same set of stimuli in
              very different ways, so it is important to collect and integrate
              these experimental data in a cell-type specific manner in order
              to properly model these processes. In practice, however, cellular
              or biochemical models were usually constructed separately, with
              data from multiple cell sources, making it difficult to compare
              or combine these models. To circumvent this problem, we propose
              to conduct the model integration at the data level. To facilitate
              this purpose we have designed a data structure (CellFrame) to
              store cell-specific data, such as cellular component measurement
              and stimulus-response, and to infer cell perturbation network (a
              cellular network representing the stimulus-response relationships
              between the cellular and/or environmental components). The
              CellFrame database consists of two data types: data classes and
              supporting classes. Data classes constitute three modules: cell
              component measurement, qualitative cell perturbation, and
              quantitative cell perturbation. Supporting classes serve as
              adaptors, linking to external molecular or literature databases.
              We have implemented an initial version of CellFrame, which
              contains data collected from reported experiments on human brain
              astrocytoma and colorectal cancer cell lines
              (http://cellframe.bioknowledge.org). Perturbation networks are

              on the basis of the known biochemical interaction topology.
              Simulating the model in the computer faithfully reproduces the
              known activity sequence of regulatory proteins along the cell
              cycle of the living cell. Contrary to existing differential

              structure of the regulatory circuitry. The dynamical properties
              of the model indicate that the biological dynamical sequence is
              robustly implemented in the regulatory network, with the
              biological stationary state G1 corresponding to the dominant
              attractor in state space, and with the biological regulatory

              cancer cells. However, the role of PKCiota in lung tumor
              development has not been investigated. To address this question,
              we established a mouse model in which oncogenic Kras(G12D) is
              activated by Cre-mediated recombination in the lung with or
              without simultaneous genetic loss of the mouse PKCiota gene,

              hyperplasia and subsequent lung tumor formation in vivo. This
              effect correlates with a defect in the ability of Prkci-deficient
              bronchioalveolar stem cells to undergo Kras-mediated expansion
              and morphologic transformation in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore,

              Kras-mediated bronchioalveolar stem cell expansion and lung tumor
              growth in vivo. Thus, Prkci is required for oncogene-induced
              expansion and transformation of tumor-initiating lung stem cells.
              Furthermore, aurothiomalate is an effective antitumor agent that
              targets the tumor-initiating stem cell niche in vivo. These data
              have important implications for PKCiota as a therapeutic target

               problems that make it difficult for PTS to accommodate many

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Understanding interactions between mutations and how
              they affect fitness is a central problem in evolutionary biology
              that bears on such fundamental issues as the structure of fitness
              landscapes and the evolution of sex. To date, analyses of fitness
              landscapes have focused either on the overall directional
              curvature of the fitness landscape or on the distribution of
              pairwise interactions. In this paper, we propose and employ a new
              mathematical approach that allows a more complete description of
              multi-way interactions and provides new insights into the
              structure of fitness landscapes. RESULTS: We apply the
              mathematical theory of gene interactions developed by
              Beerenwinkel et al. to a fitness landscape for Escherichia coli
              obtained by Elena and Lenski. The genotypes were constructed by
              introducing nine mutations into a wild-type strain and
              constructing a restricted set of 27 double mutants. Despite the
              absence of mutants higher than second order, our analysis of this
              genotypic space points to previously unappreciated gene
              interactions, in addition to the standard pairwise epistasis. Our
              analysis confirms Elena and Lenski's inference that the fitness
              landscape is complex, so that an overall measure of curvature
              obscures a diversity of interaction types. We also demonstrate
              that some mutations contribute disproportionately to this
              complexity. In particular, some mutations are systematically
              better than others at mixing with other mutations. We also find a
              strong correlation between epistasis and the average fitness loss
              caused by deleterious mutations. In particular, the epistatic
              deviations from multiplicative expectations tend toward more
              positive values in the context of more deleterious mutations,
              emphasizing that pairwise epistasis is a local property of the
              fitness landscape. Finally, we determine the geometry of the
              fitness landscape, which reflects many of these biologically
              interesting features. CONCLUSION: A full description of complex
              fitness landscapes requires more information than the average
              curvature or the distribution of independent pairwise
              interactions. We have proposed a mathematical approach that, in
              principle, allows a complete description and, in practice, can
              suggest new insights into the structure of real fitness
              landscapes. Our analysis emphasizes the value of non-independent
              genotypes for these inferences.",

  abstract = "Multidrug combinations are increasingly important in combating
              the spread of antibiotic-resistance in bacterial pathogens. On a
              broader scale, such combinations are also important in
              understanding microbial ecology and evolution. Although the
              effects of multidrug combinations on bacterial growth have been
              studied extensively, relatively little is known about their
              impact on the differential selection between sensitive and
              resistant bacterial populations. Normally, the presence of a drug
              confers an advantage on its resistant mutants in competition with
              the sensitive wild-type population. Here we show, by using a
              direct competition assay between doxycycline-resistant and
              doxycycline-sensitive Escherichia coli, that this differential
              selection can be inverted in a hyper-antagonistic class of drug
              combinations. Used in such a combination, a drug can render the
              combined treatment selective against the drug's own resistance
              allele. Further, this inversion of selection seems largely
              insensitive to the underlying resistance mechanism and occurs, at
              sublethal concentrations, while maintaining inhibition of the
              wild type. These seemingly paradoxical results can be
              rationalized in terms of a simple geometric argument. Our
              findings demonstrate a previously unappreciated feature of the
              fitness landscape for the evolution of resistance and point to a
              trade-off between the effect of drug interactions on absolute
              potency and the relative competitive selection that they impose
              on emerging resistant populations.",

  abstract = "An important goal of whole-cell computational modeling is to
              integrate detailed biochemical information with biological
              intuition to produce testable predictions. Based on the premise
              that prokaryotes such as Escherichia coli have maximized their
              growth performance along evolution, flux balance analysis (FBA)
              predicts metabolic flux distributions at steady state by using
              linear programming. Corroborating earlier results, we show that
              recent intracellular flux data for wild-type E. coli JM101
              display excellent agreement with FBA predictions. Although the
              assumption of optimality for a wild-type bacterium is
              justifiable, the same argument may not be valid for genetically
              engineered knockouts or other bacterial strains that were not
              exposed to long-term evolutionary pressure. We address this point
              by introducing the method of minimization of metabolic adjustment
              (MOMA), whereby we test the hypothesis that knockout metabolic
              fluxes undergo a minimal redistribution with respect to the flux
              configuration of the wild type. MOMA employs quadratic
              programming to identify a point in flux space, which is closest
              to the wild-type point, compatibly with the gene deletion
              constraint. Comparing MOMA and FBA predictions to experimental
              flux data for E. coli pyruvate kinase mutant PB25, we find that
              MOMA displays a significantly higher correlation than FBA. Our
              method is further supported by experimental data for E. coli
              knockout growth rates. It can therefore be used for predicting
              the behavior of perturbed metabolic networks, whose growth
              performance is in general suboptimal. MOMA and its possible
              future extensions may be useful in understanding the evolutionary
              optimization of metabolism.",

              phenomenon that the effect of a given gene on a phenotype can be
              dependent on one or more other genes, and is an essential element
              for understanding the association between genetic and phenotypic
              variations. Quantifying epistasis of orders higher than two is
              very challenging due to both the computational complexity of
              enumerating all possible combinations in genome-wide data and the
              lack of efficient and effective methodologies. OBJECTIVES: In
              this study, we propose a fast, non-parametric, and model-free
              measure for three-way epistasis. METHODS: Such a measure is based
              on information gain, and is able to separate all lower order
              effects from pure three-way epistasis. RESULTS: Our method was
              verified on synthetic data and applied to real data from a
              candidate-gene study of tuberculosis in a West African
              population. In the tuberculosis data, we found a statistically
              significant pure three-way epistatic interaction effect that was

  abstract = "Glycolysis, an ancient energy-processing pathway, can operate
              either under an efficient but slow regime or, alternatively,
              under a dissipative but fast-working regime. Trading an increase
              in efficiency for a decrease in rate represents a cooperative
              behavior, while a dissipative metabolism can be regarded as a
              cheating strategy. Herein, using irreversible thermodynamic
              principles and methods derived from game theory, we investigate
              whether, and under what conditions, the interplay between these
              two metabolic strategies may have promoted the clustering of
              undifferentiated cells. In the current model, multicellularity

              than a improvement when competing with mobile single-celled
              organisms. Despite that, when considering glycolysis as the only
              energy-processing pathway, we conclude that cells endowed with a
              low basal anabolic metabolism may have benefited from clustering
              when faced to compete with cells exhibiting a high anabolic
              activity. The current results suggest that the transition to

              new goal shares the same set of sub-problems with previous goals.
              Such modularly varying goals can also dramatically speed up

              low pH, by dynamic re-organization of respiration, and this feeds
              upwards to affect cell division. These complex dynamics can be

              developed a data structure for storing cell perturbation results
              and deducing perturbation networks (CellFrame). For automating
              network analysis, we here propose a computational method called
              the {"}alternative pathway approach{"} (ALPA) in this work. This
              method can validate the signaling networks with conditional
              perturbation data extracted from published experiments, and can
              suggest additional tests to improve the network. It searches the
              alternative pathway space between all pairs of nodes, constructs
              pathnets (set of pathways between two nodes) and validates the
              network edges using conditional perturbation. For pathnets
              without conditional data, experiments with the fewest number of
              perturbations or the most parsimonious are designed. For pathnets
              without experimentally derived or detected pair-wise
              interactions, ALPA can predict the potential effects or propose
              additional pathways to expand the existing network. We have
              tested the ALPA method on the TNFalpha-MAPK signaling cascade;
              the reconstructed network is consistent with the consensus model.
              We also used the ALPA algorithm to analyze a yeast gene

               the opportunity to prepare in advance for the next environmental
               change. In analogy to classical Pavlovian conditioning,
               microorganisms may have evolved to anticipate environmental
               stimuli by adapting to their temporal order of appearance. Here
               we present evidence for environmental change anticipation in two

               because pre-exposure to the stimulus that typically appears
               early in the ecology improves the organism's fitness when
               encountered with a second stimulus. Additionally, we observe
               loss of the conditioned response in E. coli strains that were
               repeatedly exposed in a laboratory evolution experiment only to
               the first stimulus. Focusing on the molecular level reveals that
               the natural temporal order of stimuli is embedded in the wiring
               of the regulatory network-early stimuli pre-induce genes that
               would be needed for later ones, yet later stimuli only induce
               genes needed to cope with them. Our work indicates that
               environmental anticipation is an adaptive trait that was

              evolutionary maintenance of the redundancy remains unexplained.
              Using a systems biology approach, we infer that 37-47\% of
              metabolic reactions in Escherichia coli and yeast can be
              individually removed without blocking the production of any
              biomass component under any nutritional condition. However, the
              majority of these redundant reactions are preserved because they
              have differential maximal efficiencies at different conditions or
              their loss causes an immediate fitness reduction that can only be
              regained via mutation, drift, and selection in evolution. The
              remaining redundancies are attributable to pleiotropic effects or
              recent horizontal gene transfers. We find that E. coli and yeast
              exhibit opposite relationships between the functional importance
              and redundancy level of a reaction, which is inconsistent with
              the conjecture that redundancies are preserved as an adaptation
              to back up important parts in the system. Interestingly, the
              opposite relationships can both be recapitulated by a simple
              model in which the natural environments of the organisms change
              frequently. Thus, adaptive backup is neither necessary nor
              sufficient to explain the high redundancy of cellular metabolic
              networks. Taken together, our results strongly suggest that
              redundant reactions are not kept as backups and that the genetic
              robustness of metabolic networks is an evolutionary by-product.",

              restore viability to this disrupted strain. One suppressor
              mutation is erg11, which is blocked in 14alpha-demethylation of
              lanosterol and is itself an auxotroph. The second suppressor
              mutation required is either slu1 or slu2 (suppressor of
              lanosterol utilization). These mutations are leaky versions of
              HEM2 and HEM4, respectively; addition of exogenous hemin reverses
              the suppressing effects of slu1 and slu2. Suppression of erg25 by
              erg11 slu1 (or erg11 slu2) results in a slow-growing strain in
              which lanosterol, the first sterol in the pathway, accumulates.
              This result indicates that endogenously synthesized lanosterol

              mutants, all but 1 (ERG6) of the 13 subsequent reactions of the

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Inference of evolutionary trees using the maximum
              likelihood principle is NP-hard. Therefore, all practical methods
              rely on heuristics. The topological transformations often used in
              heuristics are Nearest Neighbor Interchange (NNI), Subtree Prune
              and Regraft (SPR) and Tree Bisection and Reconnection (TBR).
              However, these topological transformations often fall easily into
              local optima, since there are not many trees accessible in one
              step from any given tree. Another more exhaustive topological
              transformation is p-Edge Contraction and Refinement (p-ECR).
              However, due to its high computation complexity, p-ECR has rarely
              been used in practice. RESULTS: To make the p-ECR move more
              efficient, this paper proposes a new method named p-ECRNJ. The
              main idea of p-ECRNJ is to use neighbor joining (NJ) to refine
              the unresolved nodes produced in p-ECR. CONCLUSION: Experiments
              with real datasets show that p-ECRNJ can find better trees than

              in particular play a key role in the attempt to obtain a
              quantitative understanding of cellular metabolism at genome
              scale. In essence, their goal is to frame the metabolic
              capabilities of an organism based on minimal assumptions that
              describe the steady states of the underlying reaction network via
              suitable stoichiometric constraints, specifically mass balance
              and energy balance (i.e. thermodynamic feasibility). The

              phase, cAMP levels increased triggering the breakdown of storage
              carbohydrates and the increased influx of glucose into the
              glycolytic pathway activated production of glycerol and ethanol
              consuming NADH. The resulting increase in the NAD(+)/NADH ratio
              stimulated respiration in combination with a decrease in the
              level of ATP, which was consumed mainly in the formation of
              biomass accompanying budding, and the accumulated ethanol and
              glycerol were gradually degraded by respiration via
              NAD(+)-dependent oxidation to acetate and the respiratory phase
              ceased after the recovery of NADH and ATP levels. However, the
              mRNA levels of both synthetic and degradative enzymes of storage
              carbohydrates were increased around the early
              respiro-fermentative phase, when storage carbohydrates are being
              synthesized, suggesting that the synthetic enzymes were expressed
              directly as active forms while the degradative enzymes were
              activated late by cAMP. In summary, the energy-metabolism
              oscillation is basically regulated by a feedback loop of
              oxido-reductive reactions of energy metabolism mediated by
              metabolites like NADH and ATP, and is modulated by metabolism of
              storage carbohydrates in combination of post-translational and
              transcriptional regulation of the related enzymes. A potential
              mechanism of energy-metabolism oscillation is proposed.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: The detection of true significant cases under
              multiple testing is becoming a fundamental issue when analyzing
              high-dimensional biological data. Unfortunately, known multitest
              adjustments reduce their statistical power as the number of tests
              increase. We propose a new multitest adjustment, based on a
              sequential goodness of fit metatest (SGoF), which increases its
              statistical power with the number of tests. The method is
              compared with Bonferroni and FDR-based alternatives by simulating
              a multitest context via two different kinds of tests: 1)
              one-sample t-test, and 2) homogeneity G-test. RESULTS: It is
              shown that SGoF behaves especially well with small sample sizes
              when 1) the alternative hypothesis is weakly to moderately
              deviated from the null model, 2) there are widespread effects
              through the family of tests, and 3) the number of tests is large.
              CONCLUSION: Therefore, SGoF should become an important tool for
              multitest adjustment when working with high-dimensional
              biological data.",

               in metabolic systems",
  author    = "Barve, Aditya and Wagner, Andreas",
  abstract  = "Some evolutionary innovations may originate non-adaptively as
               exaptations, or pre-adaptations, which are by-products of other
               adaptive traits. Examples include feathers, which originated
               before they were used in flight, and lens crystallins, which are
               light-refracting proteins that originated as enzymes. The
               question of how often adaptive traits have non-adaptive origins
               has profound implications for evolutionary biology, but is
               difficult to address systematically. Here we consider this issue
               in metabolism, one of the most ancient biological systems that
               is central to all life. We analyse a metabolic trait of great
               adaptive importance: the ability of a metabolic reaction network
               to synthesize all biomass from a single source of carbon and
               energy. We use novel computational methods to sample randomly
               many metabolic networks that can sustain life on any given
               carbon source but contain an otherwise random set of known
               biochemical reactions. We show that when we require such
               networks to be viable on one particular carbon source, they are
               typically also viable on multiple other carbon sources that were
               not targets of selection. For example, viability on glucose may
               entail viability on up to 44 other sole carbon sources. Any one
               adaptation in these metabolic systems typically entails multiple
               potential exaptations. Metabolic systems thus contain a latent
               potential for evolutionary innovations with non-adaptive
               origins. Our observations suggest that many more metabolic
               traits may have non-adaptive origins than is appreciated at
               present. They also challenge our ability to distinguish adaptive
               from non-adaptive traits.",

              cytosolic factor, pyruvate decarboxylase, is required for the
              non-malate-dependent oxidation of pyruvate by mitochondria. In
              pyruvate decarboxylase-negative mutants, the oxidation of
              pyruvate by permeabilized spheroplasts was abolished. In
              contrast, deletion of the gene (PDA1) encoding the E1alpha
              subunit of the pyruvate dehydrogenase did not affect the
              spheroplast respiratory rate on pyruvate but abolished the
              malate-dependent respiration of isolated mitochondria. Mutants
              disrupted for the mitochondrial acetaldehyde dehydrogenase gene
              (ALD7) did not oxidize pyruvate unless malate was added. We
              therefore propose the existence of a mitochondrial pyruvate
              dehydrogenase bypass different from the cytosolic one, where
              pyruvate is decarboxylated to acetaldehyde in the cytosol by
              pyruvate decarboxylase and then oxidized by mitochondrial
              acetaldehyde dehydrogenase. This pathway can compensate PDA1 gene
              deletion for lactate or respiratory glucose growth. However, the
              codisruption of PDA1 and ALD7 genes prevented the growth on
              lactate, indicating that each of these pathways contributes to
              the oxidative metabolism of pyruvate.",

  abstract = "Signals transduced by kinases depend on the extent and duration
              of substrate phosphorylation. We generated genetically encoded
              fluorescent reporters for PKC activity that reversibly respond to
              stimuli activating PKC. Specifically, phosphorylation of the
              reporter expressed in mammalian cells causes changes in
              fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), allowing real time
              imaging of phosphorylation resulting from PKC activation.
              Targeting of the reporter to the plasma membrane, where PKC is
              activated, reveals oscillatory phosphorylation in HeLa cells in
              response to histamine. Each oscillation in substrate
              phosphorylation follows a calcium oscillation with a lag of
              approximately 10 s. Novel FRET-based reporters for PKC
              translocation, phosphoinositide bisphosphate conversion to IP3,
              and diacylglycerol show that in HeLa cells the oscillatory
              phosphorylations correlate with Ca2+-controlled translocation of
              conventional PKC to the membrane without oscillations of PLC
              activity or diacylglycerol. However, in MDCK cells stimulated
              with ATP, PLC and diacylglycerol fluctuate together with Ca2+ and
              phosphorylation. Thus, specificity of PKC signaling depends on
              the local second messenger-controlled equilibrium between kinase
              and phosphatase activities to result in strict calcium-controlled
              temporal regulation of substrate phosphorylation.",

  abstract  = "abstract: A holey adaptive landscape is an adaptive landscape
               where relatively infrequent well‐fit combinations of genes form
               a contiguous set that expands throughout the genotype space. I
               formulate and study a series of simple models describing the
               dynamics of speciation on holey adaptive landscapes driven by
               mutation and random genetic drift. Unlike most previous models
               that concentrate only on some stages of speciation, the models
               studied here describe the complete process of speciation from
               initiation until completion. The evolutionary factors included
               are selection (reproductive isolation), random genetic drift,
               mutation, recombination, and migration. In these models, pre‐
               and postmating reproductive isolation is a consequence of
               cumulative genetic change. I study possibilities for speciation
               according to allopatric, parapatric, peripatric, and vicariance
               scenarios. The results presented here, together with earlier
               numerical simulations, strongly suggest that rapid speciation,
               including simultaneous emergence of several new species, is a
               plausible outcome of the evolutionary dynamics of subdivided
               populations. Rapid speciation is most likely for populations
               that are subdivided into a large number of small subpopulations.
               Speciation is possible even when subpopulations exchange several
               individuals per generation. Selection for local adaptation is
               not necessary for rapid speciation. I briefly discuss
               implications of the dynamics on holey adaptive landscapes for
               the nearly neutral theory of molecular evolution and for the
               theory of evolution of genetic canalization. CR - Copyright

  abstract = "Genomic data allow the large-scale manual or semi-automated
              assembly of metabolic network reconstructions, which provide
              highly curated organism-specific knowledge bases. Although
              several genome-scale network reconstructions describe
              Saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolism, they differ in scope and
              content, and use different terminologies to describe the same
              chemical entities. This makes comparisons between them difficult
              and underscores the desirability of a consolidated metabolic
              network that collects and formalizes the 'community knowledge' of
              yeast metabolism. We describe how we have produced a consensus
              metabolic network reconstruction for S. cerevisiae. In drafting
              it, we placed special emphasis on referencing molecules to
              persistent databases or using database-independent forms, such as
              SMILES or InChI strings, as this permits their chemical structure
              to be represented unambiguously and in a manner that permits
              automated reasoning. The reconstruction is readily available via
              a publicly accessible database and in the Systems Biology Markup
              Language (http://www.comp-sys-bio.org/yeastnet). It can be
              maintained as a resource that serves as a common denominator for
              studying the systems biology of yeast. Similar strategies should
              benefit communities studying genome-scale metabolic networks of
              other organisms.",

                 hallmarks of cancer (Hanahan and Weinberg Cell 100:5770,
                 2000), it has become increasingly clear that mutated cells on
                 their way to giving rise to a tumor have also to learn how to
                 thrive in a chronically inflamed microenvironment, evade
                 immune recognition, and suppress immune reactivity. Genetic
                 and molecular definition of these three immune hallmarks of
                 cancer offers the opportunity to learn how to deploy specific
                 countermeasures to reverse the situation in favor of the
                 immune system and, eventually, the patient. This new

                 three major hallmarks for the immune control of cancer

                 reactivity; characterization of not-disposable oncoantigens;
