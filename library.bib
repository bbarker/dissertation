abstract = {Genome-scale metabolic models are built using information from an organism's annotated genome and, correspondingly, information on reactions catalyzed by the set of metabolic enzymes encoded by the genome. These models have been successfully applied to guide metabolic engineering to increase production of metabolites of industrial interest. Congruity between simulated and experimental metabolic behavior is influenced by the accuracy of the representation of the metabolic network in the model. In the interest of applying the consensus model of Saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolism for increased productivity of triglycerides, we manually evaluated the representation of fatty acid, glycerophospholipid, and glycerolipid metabolism in the consensus model (Yeast v6.0). These areas of metabolism were chosen due to their tightly interconnected nature to triglyceride synthesis. Manual curation was facilitated by custom MATLAB functions that return information contained in the model for reactions associated with genes and metabolites within the stated areas of metabolism. Through manual curation, we have identified inconsistencies between information contained in the model and literature knowledge. These inconsistencies include incorrect gene-reaction associations, improper definition of substrates/products in reactions, inappropriate assignments of reaction directionality, nonfunctional $\beta$-oxidation pathways, and missing reactions relevant to the synthesis and degradation of triglycerides. Suggestions to amend these inconsistencies in the Yeast v6.0 model can be implemented through a MATLAB script provided in the Supplementary Materials, Supplementary Data S1 (Supplementary Data are available online at www.liebertpub.com/ind).},

abstract = {Nuclear-pore complexes (NPCs) are large protein channels that span the nuclear envelope (NE), which is a double membrane that encloses the nuclear genome of eukaryotes. Each of the typically 2,000-4,000 pores in the NE of vertebrate cells is composed of multiple copies of 30 different proteins known as nucleoporins. The evolutionarily conserved NPC proteins have the well-characterized function of mediating the transport of molecules between the nucleoplasm and the cytoplasm. Mutations in nucleoporins are often linked to specific developmental defects and disease, and the resulting phenotypes are usually interpreted as the consequences of perturbed nuclear transport activity. However, recent evidence suggests that NPCs have additional functions in chromatin organization and gene regulation, some of which might be independent of nuclear transport. Here, we review the transport-dependent and transport-independent roles of NPCs in the regulation of nuclear function and gene expression.},

@article{DeLuna2008,
abstract = {Duplicate genes from the whole-genome duplication (WGD) in yeast are often dispensable--removing one copy has little or no phenotypic consequence. It is unknown, however, whether such dispensability reflects insignificance of the ancestral function or compensation from paralogs. Here, using precise competition-based measurements of the fitness cost of single and double deletions, we estimate the exposed fitness contribution of WGD duplicate genes in metabolism and bound the importance of their ancestral pre-duplication function. We find that the functional overlap between paralogs sufficiently explains the apparent dispensability of individual WGD genes. Furthermore, the lower bound on the fitness value of the ancestral function, which is estimated by the degree of synergistic epistasis, is at least as large as the average fitness cost of deleting single non-WGD genes. These results suggest that most metabolic functions encoded by WGD genes are important today and were also important at the time of duplication.},

@article{Rokas2003,
abstract = {One of the most pervasive challenges in molecular phylogenetics is the incongruence between phylogenies obtained using different data sets, such as individual genes. To systematically investigate the degree of incongruence, and potential methods for resolving it, we screened the genome sequences of eight yeast species and selected 106 widely distributed orthologous genes for phylogenetic analyses, singly and by concatenation. Our results suggest that data sets consisting of single or a small number of concatenated genes have a significant probability of supporting conflicting topologies. By contrast, analyses of the entire data set of concatenated genes yielded a single, fully resolved species tree with maximum support. Comparable results were obtained with a concatenation of a minimum of 20 genes; substantially more genes than commonly used but a small fraction of any genome. These results have important implications for resolving branches of the tree of life.},

abstract = {After hundreds of generations of adaptive evolution at exponential growth, Escherichia coli grows as predicted using flux balance analysis (FBA) on genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs). However, it is not known whether the predicted pathway usage in FBA solutions is consistent with gene and protein expression in the wild-type and evolved strains. Here, we report that >98\% of active reactions from FBA optimal growth solutions are supported by transcriptomic and proteomic data. Moreover, when E. coli adapts to growth rate selective pressure, the evolved strains upregulate genes within the optimal growth predictions, and downregulate genes outside of the optimal growth solutions. In addition, bottlenecks from dosage limitations of computationally predicted essential genes are overcome in the evolved strains. We also identify regulatory processes that may contribute to the development of the optimal growth phenotype in the evolved strains, such as the downregulation of known regulons and stringent response suppression. Thus, differential gene and protein expression from wild-type and adaptively evolved strains supports observed growth phenotype changes, and is consistent with GEM-computed optimal growth states.},

@article{Khairallah2004,
abstract = {The availability of genetically modified mice requires the development of methods to assess heart function and metabolism in the intact beating organ. With the use of radioactive substrates and ex vivo perfusion of the mouse heart in the working mode, previous studies have documented glucose and fatty acid oxidation pathways. This study was aimed at characterizing the metabolism of other potentially important exogenous carbohydrate sources, namely, lactate and pyruvate. This was achieved by using (13)C-labeling methods. The mouse heart perfusion setup and buffer composition were optimized to reproduce conditions close to the in vivo milieu in terms of workload, cardiac functions, and substrate-hormone supply to the heart (11 mM glucose, 0.8 nM insulin, 50 microM carnitine, 1.5 mM lactate, 0.2 mM pyruvate, 5 nM epinephrine, 0.7 mM oleate, and 3\% albumin). The use of three differentially (13)C-labeled carbohydrates and a (13)C-labeled long-chain fatty acid allowed the quantitative assessment of the metabolic origin and fate of tissue pyruvate as well as the relative contribution of substrates feeding acetyl-CoA (pyruvate and fatty acids) and oxaloacetate (pyruvate) for mitochondrial citrate synthesis. Beyond concurring with the notion that the mouse heart preferentially uses fatty acids for energy production (63.5 +/- 3.9\%) and regulates its fuel selection according to the Randle cycle, our study reports for the first time in the mouse heart the following findings. First, exogenous lactate is the major carbohydrate contributing to pyruvate formation (42.0 +/- 2.3\%). Second, lactate and pyruvate are constantly being taken up and released by the heart, supporting the concept of compartmentation of lactate and glucose metabolism. Finally, mitochondrial anaplerotic pyruvate carboxylation and citrate efflux represent 4.9 +/- 1.8 and 0.8 +/- 0.1\%, respectively, of the citric acid cycle flux and are modulated by substrate supply. The described (13)C-labeling strategy combined with an experimental setup that enables continuous monitoring of physiological parameters offers a unique model to clarify the link between metabolic alterations, cardiac dysfunction, and disease development.},

@article{Gresham2008,
abstract = {The experimental evolution of laboratory populations of microbes provides an opportunity to observe the evolutionary dynamics of adaptation in real time. Until very recently, however, such studies have been limited by our inability to systematically find mutations in evolved organisms. We overcome this limitation by using a variety of DNA microarray-based techniques to characterize genetic changes -- including point mutations, structural changes, and insertion variation -- that resulted from the experimental adaptation of 24 haploid and diploid cultures of Saccharomyces cerevisiae to growth in either glucose, sulfate, or phosphate-limited chemostats for approximately 200 generations. We identified frequent genomic amplifications and rearrangements as well as novel retrotransposition events associated with adaptation. Global nucleotide variation detection in ten clonal isolates identified 32 point mutations. On the basis of mutation frequencies, we infer that these mutations and the subsequent dynamics of adaptation are determined by the batch phase of growth prior to initiation of the continuous phase in the chemostat. We relate these genotypic changes to phenotypic outcomes, namely global patterns of gene expression, and to increases in fitness by 5-50\%. We found that the spectrum of available mutations in glucose- or phosphate-limited environments combined with the batch phase population dynamics early in our experiments allowed several distinct genotypic and phenotypic evolutionary pathways in response to these nutrient limitations. By contrast, sulfate-limited populations were much more constrained in both genotypic and phenotypic outcomes. Thus, the reproducibility of evolution varies with specific selective pressures, reflecting the constraints inherent in the system-level organization of metabolic processes in the cell. We were able to relate some of the observed adaptive mutations (e.g., transporter gene amplifications) to known features of the relevant metabolic pathways, but many of the mutations pointed to genes not previously associated with the relevant physiology. Thus, in addition to answering basic mechanistic questions about evolutionary mechanisms, our work suggests that experimental evolution can also shed light on the function and regulation of individual metabolic pathways.},

A major goal of systems biology is to understand these behaviours in terms of individual genes and their interactions. However, traditional techniques based on population averages 'wash out' crucial dynamics that are either unsynchronized between cells or are driven by fluctuations, or 'noise', in cellular components. Recently, the combination of time-lapse microscopy, quantitative image analysis and fluorescent protein reporters has enabled direct observation of multiple cellular components over time in individual cells. In conjunction with mathematical modelling, these techniques are now providing powerful insights into genetic circuit behaviour in diverse microbial systems.},

abstract = {Predicting protein-protein interactions has become a key step of reverse-engineering biological networks to better understand cellular functions. The experimental methods in determining protein-protein interactions are time-consuming and costly, which has motivated vigorous development of computational approaches for predicting protein-protein interactions. A set of recently developed bioinformatics methods utilizes coevolutionary information of the interacting partners (e.g., as exhibited in the form of correlations between distance matrices, where, for each protein, a matrix stores the pairwise distances between the protein and its orthologs in a group of reference genomes). We proposed a novel method to account for the intra-matrix correlations in improving predictive accuracy. The distance matrices for a pair of proteins are transformed and concatenated into a phylogenetic vector. A least-squares support vector machine is trained and tested on pairs of proteins, represented as phylogenetic vectors, whose interactions are known. The intra-matrix correlations are accounted for by introducing a weighted linear kernel, which determines the dot product of two phylogenetic vectors. The performance, measured as receiver operator characteristic (ROC) score in cross-validation experiments, shows significant improvement of our method (ROC score 0.928) over that obtained by Pearson correlations (0.659).},

abstract = {Under laboratory conditions 80\% of yeast genes seem not to be essential for viability. This raises the question of what the mechanistic basis for dispensability is, and whether it is the result of selection for buffering or an incidental side product. Here we analyse these issues using an in silico flux model of the yeast metabolic network. The model correctly predicts the knockout fitness effects in 88\% of the genes studied and in vivo fluxes. Dispensable genes might be important, but under conditions not yet examined in the laboratory. Our model indicates that this is the dominant explanation for apparent dispensability, accounting for 37-68\% of dispensable genes, whereas 15-28\% of them are compensated by a duplicate, and only 4-17\% are buffered by metabolic network flux reorganization. For over one-half of those not important under nutrient-rich conditions, we can predict conditions when they will be important. As expected, such condition-specific genes have a more restricted phylogenetic distribution. Gene duplicates catalysing the same reaction are not more common for indispensable reactions, suggesting that the reason for their retention is not to provide compensation. Instead their presence is better explained by selection for high enzymatic flux.},

abstract = {abstract: A holey adaptive landscape is an adaptive landscape where relatively infrequent well‐fit combinations of genes form a contiguous set that expands throughout the genotype space. I formulate and study a series of simple models describing the dynamics of speciation on holey adaptive landscapes driven by mutation and random genetic drift. Unlike most previous models that concentrate only on some stages of speciation, the models studied here describe the complete process of speciation from initiation until completion. The evolutionary factors included are selection (reproductive isolation), random genetic drift, mutation, recombination, and migration. In these models, pre‐ and postmating reproductive isolation is a consequence of cumulative genetic change. I study possibilities for speciation according to allopatric, parapatric, peripatric, and vicariance scenarios. The results presented here, together with earlier numerical simulations, strongly suggest that rapid speciation, including simultaneous emergence of several new species, is a plausible outcome of the evolutionary dynamics of subdivided populations. Rapid speciation is most likely for populations that are subdivided into a large number of small subpopulations. Speciation is possible even when subpopulations exchange several individuals per generation. Selection for local adaptation is not necessary for rapid speciation. I briefly discuss implications of the dynamics on holey adaptive landscapes for the nearly neutral theory of molecular evolution and for the theory of evolution of genetic canalization.

PPIs typically involve binding between domains, the basic units of protein folding, evolution and function. Identifying domain-domain interactions (DDIs) would aid understanding PPI networks. Recently, many computational methods aimed to infer DDIs from databases of interacting proteins and subsequently used the inferred DDIs to predict new PPIs. We attempt to describe systematically current domain-based approaches including the association method, maximum likelihood estimation and parsimonious explanation method. The performance of these methods at inferring DDIs and predicting PPIs was evaluated comparatively. We observe that each method generates artefacts in certain situations and discuss biases in the available benchmark sets.},

abstract = {The classic algorithms of Needleman-Wunsch and Smith-Waterman find a maximum a posteriori probability alignment for a pair hidden Markov model (PHMM). To process large genomes that have undergone complex genome rearrangements, almost all existing whole genome alignment methods apply fast heuristics to divide genomes into small pieces that are suitable for Needleman-Wunsch alignment. In these alignment methods, it is standard practice to fix the parameters and to produce a single alignment for subsequent analysis by biologists. As the number of alignment programs applied on a whole genome scale continues to increase, so does the disagreement in their results. The alignments produced by different programs vary greatly, especially in non-coding regions of eukaryotic genomes where the biologically correct alignment is hard to find. Parametric alignment is one possible remedy. This methodology resolves the issue of robustness to changes in parameters by finding all optimal alignments for all possible parameters in a PHMM. Our main result is the construction of a whole genome parametric alignment of Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila pseudoobscura. This alignment draws on existing heuristics for dividing whole genomes into small pieces for alignment, and it relies on advances we have made in computing convex polytopes that allow us to parametrically align non-coding regions using biologically realistic models. We demonstrate the utility of our parametric alignment for biological inference by showing that cis-regulatory elements are more conserved between Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila pseudoobscura than previously thought. We also show how whole genome parametric alignment can be used to quantitatively assess the dependence of branch length estimates on alignment parameters.},

abstract = {In the present work dynamic changes of free intracellular amino acid pools during autonomous oscillations of Saccharomyces cerevisiae were quantified in glucose-limited continuous cultivations. At a dilution rate of D = 0.22 h(-1) cyclic changes with a period of 120 min were found for many variables such as carbon dioxide production rate, dissolved oxygen, pH, biomass content, and various metabolite concentrations. On the basis of the observed dynamic patterns, free intracellular amino acids were classified to show oscillatory, stationary, or chaotic behavior. Amino acid pools such as serine, alanine, valine, leucine, or lysine were subjected to clear oscillations with a frequency of 120 min, identical to that of other described cultivation variables, indicating that there is a direct correlation between the periodic changes of amino acid concentrations and the metabolic oscillations on the cellular level. The oscillations of these amino acids were unequally phase-delayed and had different amplitudes of oscillation. Accordingly, they exhibited different patterns in phase plane plots vs. intracellular trehalose. Despite the complex and marked metabolic changes during oscillation, selected intracellular amino acids such as histidine, threonine, isoleucine, or arginine remained about constant. Concentrations of glutamate and glutamine showed a chaotic behavior. However, the ratio of glutamate to glutamine concentration was found to be oscillatory, with a period of 60 min and a corresponding figure eight-shaped pattern in a plot vs. trehalose concentration. Considering the described diversity, it can be concluded that the observed periodic changes are neither just the consequence of low or high rates of protein biosynthesis/degradation nor correlated to changing cell volumes during oscillation. The ratio between doubling time (189 min) and period of oscillation of intracellular amino acids (120 min) was 1:6. The fact that there is a close relationship between doubling time and period of oscillation underlines that the described autonomous oscillations are cell-cycle-associated.},

This double-negative feedback loop is part of a bistable trigger that makes the transition into mitosis abrupt and decisive. To generate a bistable response, some component of a double-negative feedback loop must exhibit an ultrasensitive response to its upstream regulator. Here, we experimentally demonstrate that Wee1 exhibits a highly ultrasensitive response to Cdk1. Several mechanisms can, in principle, give rise to ultrasensitivity, including zero-order effects, multisite phosphorylation, and competition mechanisms. We found that the ultrasensitivity in the inactivation of Wee1 arises mainly through two competition mechanisms: competition between two sets of phosphorylation sites in Wee1 and between Wee1 and other high-affinity Cdk1 targets. Based on these findings, we were able to reconstitute a highly ultrasensitive Wee1 response with purified components. Competition provides a simple way of generating the equivalent of a highly cooperative allosteric response.},

abstract = {An important goal of whole-cell computational modeling is to integrate detailed biochemical information with biological intuition to produce testable predictions. Based on the premise that prokaryotes such as Escherichia coli have maximized their growth performance along evolution, flux balance analysis (FBA) predicts metabolic flux distributions at steady state by using linear programming. Corroborating earlier results, we show that recent intracellular flux data for wild-type E. coli JM101 display excellent agreement with FBA predictions. Although the assumption of optimality for a wild-type bacterium is justifiable, the same argument may not be valid for genetically engineered knockouts or other bacterial strains that were not exposed to long-term evolutionary pressure. We address this point by introducing the method of minimization of metabolic adjustment (MOMA), whereby we test the hypothesis that knockout metabolic fluxes undergo a minimal redistribution with respect to the flux configuration of the wild type. MOMA employs quadratic programming to identify a point in flux space, which is closest to the wild-type point, compatibly with the gene deletion constraint. Comparing MOMA and FBA predictions to experimental flux data for E. coli pyruvate kinase mutant PB25, we find that MOMA displays a significantly higher correlation than FBA. Our method is further supported by experimental data for E. coli knockout growth rates. It can therefore be used for predicting the behavior of perturbed metabolic networks, whose growth performance is in general suboptimal. MOMA and its possible future extensions may be useful in understanding the evolutionary optimization of metabolism.},

abstract = {Which transcription factors control the distribution of metabolic fluxes under a given condition? We address this question by systematically quantifying metabolic fluxes in 119 transcription factor deletion mutants of Saccharomyces cerevisiae under five growth conditions. While most knockouts did not affect fluxes, we identified 42 condition-dependent interactions that were mediated by a total of 23 transcription factors that control almost exclusively the cellular decision between respiration and fermentation. This relatively sparse, condition-specific network of active metabolic control contrasts with the much larger gene regulation network inferred from expression and DNA binding data. Based on protein and transcript analyses in key mutants, we identified three enzymes in the tricarboxylic acid cycle as the key targets of this transcriptional control. For the transcription factor Gcn4, we demonstrate that this control is mediated through the PKA and Snf1 signaling cascade. The discrepancy between flux response predictions, based on the known regulatory network architecture and our functional (13)C-data, demonstrates the importance of identifying and quantifying the extent to which regulatory effectors alter cellular functions.},

abstract = {Changes in gene expression have been proposed to underlie many, or even most, adaptive differences between species. Despite the increasing acceptance of this view, only a handful of cases of adaptive gene expression evolution have been demonstrated. To address this discrepancy, we introduce a simple test for lineage-specific selection on gene expression. Applying the test to genome-wide gene expression data from the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we find that hundreds of gene expression levels have been subject to lineage-specific selection. Comparing these findings with independent population genetic evidence of selective sweeps suggests that this lineage-specific selection has resulted in recent sweeps at over a hundred genes, most of which led to increased transcript levels. Examination of the implicated genes revealed a specific biochemical pathway--ergosterol biosynthesis--where the expression of multiple genes has been subject to selection for reduced levels. In sum, these results suggest that adaptive evolution of gene expression is common in yeast, that regulatory adaptation can occur at the level of entire pathways, and that similar genome-wide scans may be possible in other species, including humans.},

Using a computational model of the NF-kappaB signaling network involving two negative regulators, IkappaBalpha and A20, we performed sensitivity analyses with three different sampling methods and present a ranking of the kinetic rate variables by the strength of their influence on the NF-kappaB signaling response. We also present a classification of temporal-response profiles of nuclear NF-kappaB concentration into six clusters, which can be regrouped to three biologically relevant clusters. Last, we constructed a reduced network of the IKK-NF-kappaB-IkappaBalpha-A20 signal transduction based on the ranking.},

abstract = {The ability to adapt to different conditions is key for Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB), to successfully infect human hosts. Adaptations allow the organism to evade the host immune responses during acute infections and persist for an extended period of time during the latent infectious stage. In latently infected individuals, estimated to include one-third of the human population, the organism exists in a variety of metabolic states, which impedes the development of a simple strategy for controlling or eradicating this disease. Direct knowledge of the metabolic states of M. tuberculosis in patients would aid in the management of the disease as well as in forming the basis for developing new drugs and designing more efficacious drug cocktails. Here, we propose an in silico approach to create state-specific models based on readily available gene expression data. The coupling of differential gene expression data with a metabolic network model allowed us to characterize the metabolic adaptations of M. tuberculosis H37Rv to hypoxia. Given the microarray data for the alterations in gene expression, our model predicted reduced oxygen uptake, ATP production changes, and a global change from an oxidative to a reductive tricarboxylic acid (TCA) program. Alterations in the biomass composition indicated an increase in the cell wall metabolites required for cell-wall growth, as well as heightened accumulation of triacylglycerol in preparation for a low-nutrient, low metabolic activity life style. In contrast, the gene expression program in the deletion mutant of dosR, which encodes the immediate hypoxic response regulator, failed to adapt to low-oxygen stress. Our predictions were compatible with recent experimental observations of M. tuberculosis activity under hypoxic and anaerobic conditions. Importantly, alterations in the flow and accumulation of a particular metabolite were not necessarily directly linked to differential gene expression of the enzymes catalyzing the related metabolic reactions.},

Kinetic parameters of the individual isoenzymes within these steps are measured experimentally under a standardised set of conditions. Experimental strategies are applied to establish a set of in vivo concentrations for isoenzymes and metabolites. The data are integrated into a mathematical model that is used to predict a new set of metabolite concentrations and reevaluate the control properties of the system. This bottom-up modelling study reveals that control over the metabolic network most directly involved in yeast glycolysis is more widely distributed than previously thought.},

To this end, we used DNA microarrays and samples from yeast cultures synchronized by three independent methods: alpha factor arrest, elutriation, and arrest of a cdc15 temperature-sensitive mutant. Using periodicity and correlation algorithms, we identified 800 genes that meet an objective minimum criterion for cell cycle regulation. In separate experiments, designed to examine the effects of inducing either the G1 cyclin Cln3p or the B-type cyclin Clb2p, we found that the mRNA levels of more than half of these 800 genes respond to one or both of these cyclins. Furthermore, we analyzed our set of cell cycle-regulated genes for known and new promoter elements and show that several known elements (or variations thereof) contain information predictive of cell cycle regulation.

We found that negative epistasis occurs mainly between nonessential reactions with overlapping functions, whereas positive epistasis usually involves essential reactions, is highly abundant and, unexpectedly, often occurs between reactions without overlapping functions.

Interestingly, the simulations predict a maximum xylose uptake rate at a glucose concentration >0 g/L, which suggests that the genetic expressions of the considered transport proteins are of importance when optimizing the xylose uptake. This was also evident in fed-batch simulations, where a distinct optimal glucose addition rate >0 g/L x h was found. Strategies for improving the co-substrate utilization by genetic engineering of the transport systems are furthermore suggested based on simulations.},

abstract = {With the exception of its most primitive members, mammal species practice X inactivation, where one copy of each X chromosome pair is silenced in each cell of the female body. The particular copy of the X that is silenced nevertheless shows considerable variability among species, and the evolutionary causes for this variability remain unclear. Here, we show that X inactivation strategies are likely to evolve in response to the sex-differential fitness properties of X-linked genetic variation. Genetic variation with similar effects on male and female fitness will generally favor the evolution of random X inactivation, potentially including preferential inactivation of the maternally inherited X chromosome. Variation with opposing fitness effects in each sex (“sexually antagonistic” variation, which includes mutations that both decrease female fitness and enhance male fitness) selects for preferential or complete inactivation of the paternally inherited X. Paternally biased X inactivation patterns appear to be common in nature, which suggests that sexually antagonistic genetic variation might be an important factor underlying the evolution of X inactivation. The theory provides a conceptual framework for understanding the evolution of X inactivation strategies and generates several novel predictions that may soon be tested with modern genome sequencing technologies.},

@article{Chen2009,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: The unique metabolism of tumors was described many years ago by Otto Warburg, who identified tumor cells with increased glycolysis and decreased mitochondrial activity. However, "aerobic glycolysis" generates fewer ATP per glucose molecule than mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, so in terms of energy production, it is unclear how increasing a less efficient process provides tumors with a growth advantage. METHODS/FINDINGS: We carried out a screen for loss of genetic elements in pancreatic tumor cells that accelerated their growth as tumors, and identified mitochondrial ribosomal protein L28 (MRPL28). Knockdown of MRPL28 in these cells decreased mitochondrial activity, and increased glycolysis, but paradoxically, decreased cellular growth in vitro. Following Warburg's observations, this mutation causes decreased mitochondrial function, compensatory increase in glycolysis and accelerated growth in vivo. Likewise, knockdown of either mitochondrial ribosomal protein L12 (MRPL12) or cytochrome oxidase had a similar effect. Conversely, expression of the mitochondrial uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) increased oxygen consumption and decreased tumor growth. Finally, treatment of tumor bearing animals with dichloroacetate (DCA) increased pyruvate consumption in the mitochondria, increased total oxygen consumption, increased tumor hypoxia and slowed tumor growth. CONCLUSIONS: We interpret these findings to show that non-oncogenic genetic changes that alter mitochondrial metabolism can regulate tumor growth through modulation of the consumption of oxygen, which appears to be a rate limiting substrate for tumor proliferation.},

abstract = {Variation in gene expression levels on a genomic scale has been detected among different strains, among closely related species, and within populations of genetically identical cells. What are the driving forces that lead to expression divergence in some genes and conserved expression in others? Here we employ flux balance analysis to address this question for metabolic genes. We consider the genome-scale metabolic model of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and its entire space of optimal and near-optimal flux distributions. We show that this space reveals underlying evolutionary constraints on expression regulation, as well as on the conservation of the underlying gene sequences. Genes that have a high range of optimal flux levels tend to display divergent expression levels among different yeast strains and species. This suggests that gene regulation has diverged in those parts of the metabolic network that are less constrained. In addition, we show that genes that are active in a large fraction of the space of optimal solutions tend to have conserved sequences. This supports the possibility that there is less selective pressure to maintain genes that are relevant for only a small number of metabolic states.},

abstract = {The influence of epistasis on the evolution of reproductive isolation by peak shifts is studied in a two-locus two-allele model of a quantitative genetic character under stabilizing selection. Epistasis is introduced by a simple multiplicative term in the function that maps gene effects onto genotypic values. In the model with only additive effects on the trait, the probability of a peak shift and the amount of reproductive isolation are always inversely related, i.e., the higher the peak shift rate, the lower the amount of reproductive isolation caused by the peak shift. With epistatic characters there is no consistent relationship between these two values. Interestingly, there are cases where both transition rates as well as the amount of reproductive isolation are increased relative to the additive model. This effect has two main causes: a shift in the location of the transition point, and the hybrids between the two alternative optimal genotypes have lower average fitness in the epistatic case. A review of the empirical literature shows that the fitness relations resulting in higher peak shift rates and more reproductive isolation are qualitatively the same as those observed for genes causing hybrid inferiority.},

abstract = {The distribution of fitness effects of protein mutations is still unknown. Of particular interest is whether accumulating deleterious mutations interact, and how the resulting epistatic effects shape the protein's fitness landscape. Here we apply a model system in which bacterial fitness correlates with the enzymatic activity of TEM-1 beta-lactamase (antibiotic degradation). Subjecting TEM-1 to random mutational drift and purifying selection (to purge deleterious mutations) produced changes in its fitness landscape indicative of negative epistasis; that is, the combined deleterious effects of mutations were, on average, larger than expected from the multiplication of their individual effects. As observed in computational systems, negative epistasis was tightly associated with higher tolerance to mutations (robustness). Thus, under a low selection pressure, a large fraction of mutations was initially tolerated (high robustness), but as mutations accumulated, their fitness toll increased, resulting in the observed negative epistasis. These findings, supported by FoldX stability computations of the mutational effects, prompt a new model in which the mutational robustness (or neutrality) observed in proteins, and other biological systems, is due primarily to a stability margin, or threshold, that buffers the deleterious physico-chemical effects of mutations on fitness. Threshold robustness is inherently epistatic-once the stability threshold is exhausted, the deleterious effects of mutations become fully pronounced, thereby making proteins far less robust than generally assumed.},

abstract = {A complete description of protein metabolism requires knowledge of the rates of protein production and destruction within cells. Using an epitope-tagged strain collection, we measured the half-life of >3,750 proteins in the yeast proteome after inhibition of translation. By integrating our data with previous measurements of protein and mRNA abundance and translation rate, we provide evidence that many proteins partition into one of two regimes for protein metabolism: one optimized for efficient production or a second optimized for regulatory efficiency. Incorporation of protein half-life information into a simple quantitative model for protein production improves our ability to predict steady-state protein abundance values. Analysis of a simple dynamic protein production model reveals a remarkable correlation between transcriptional regulation and protein half-life within some groups of coregulated genes, suggesting that cells coordinate these two processes to achieve uniform effects on protein abundances. Our experimental data and theoretical analysis underscore the importance of an integrative approach to the complex interplay between protein degradation, transcriptional regulation, and other determinants of protein metabolism.},

abstract = {Protein kinase Ciota (PKCiota) is an oncogene required for maintenance of the transformed phenotype of non-small cell lung cancer cells. However, the role of PKCiota in lung tumor development has not been investigated. To address this question, we established a mouse model in which oncogenic Kras(G12D) is activated by Cre-mediated recombination in the lung with or without simultaneous genetic loss of the mouse PKCiota gene, Prkci. Genetic loss of Prkci dramatically inhibits Kras-initiated hyperplasia and subsequent lung tumor formation in vivo. This effect correlates with a defect in the ability of Prkci-deficient bronchioalveolar stem cells to undergo Kras-mediated expansion and morphologic transformation in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, the small molecule PKCiota inhibitor aurothiomalate inhibits Kras-mediated bronchioalveolar stem cell expansion and lung tumor growth in vivo. Thus, Prkci is required for oncogene-induced expansion and transformation of tumor-initiating lung stem cells. Furthermore, aurothiomalate is an effective antitumor agent that targets the tumor-initiating stem cell niche in vivo. These data have important implications for PKCiota as a therapeutic target and for the clinical use of aurothiomalate for lung cancer treatment.},

abstract = {Signals transduced by kinases depend on the extent and duration of substrate phosphorylation. We generated genetically encoded fluorescent reporters for PKC activity that reversibly respond to stimuli activating PKC. Specifically, phosphorylation of the reporter expressed in mammalian cells causes changes in fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), allowing real time imaging of phosphorylation resulting from PKC activation. Targeting of the reporter to the plasma membrane, where PKC is activated, reveals oscillatory phosphorylation in HeLa cells in response to histamine. Each oscillation in substrate phosphorylation follows a calcium oscillation with a lag of approximately 10 s. Novel FRET-based reporters for PKC translocation, phosphoinositide bisphosphate conversion to IP3, and diacylglycerol show that in HeLa cells the oscillatory phosphorylations correlate with Ca2+-controlled translocation of conventional PKC to the membrane without oscillations of PLC activity or diacylglycerol. However, in MDCK cells stimulated with ATP, PLC and diacylglycerol fluctuate together with Ca2+ and phosphorylation. Thus, specificity of PKC signaling depends on the local second messenger-controlled equilibrium between kinase and phosphatase activities to result in strict calcium-controlled temporal regulation of substrate phosphorylation.},

abstract = {Although several studies have provided important insights into the general principles of biological networks, the link between network organization and the genome-scale dynamics of the underlying entities (genes, mRNAs, and proteins) and its role in systems behavior remain unclear. Here we show that transcription factor (TF) dynamics and regulatory network organization are tightly linked. By classifying TFs in the yeast regulatory network into three hierarchical layers (top, core, and bottom) and integrating diverse genome-scale datasets, we find that the TFs have static and dynamic properties that are similar within a layer and different across layers. At the protein level, the top-layer TFs are relatively abundant, long-lived, and noisy compared with the core- and bottom-layer TFs. Although variability in expression of top-layer TFs might confer a selective advantage, as this permits at least some members in a clonal cell population to initiate a response to changing conditions, tight regulation of the core- and bottom-layer TFs may minimize noise propagation and ensure fidelity in regulation. We propose that the interplay between network organization and TF dynamics could permit differential utilization of the same underlying network by distinct members of a clonal cell population.},

Epistasis should make a significant contribution to variation in complex traits and influence the evolution of genetic systems as sex, diploidy, dominance, or the contamination of genomes with deleterious mutations. We have collected data from widely different organisms and quantified epistasis in a common, per-generation scale. Simpler genomes, such as those of RNA viruses, display antagonistic epistasis (mutations have smaller effects together than expected); bacterial microorganisms do not apparently deviate from independent effects, whereas in multicellular eukaryotes, a transition toward synergistic epistasis occurs (mutations have larger effects together than expected). We propose that antagonistic epistasis might be a property of compact genomes with few nonpleiotropic biological functions, whereas in complex genomes, synergism might emerge from mutational robustness.},

abstract = {An important challenge in systems biology is to quantitatively describe microbial growth using a few measurable parameters that capture the essence of this complex phenomenon. Two key events at the cell membrane-extracellular glucose sensing and uptake-initiate the budding yeast's growth on glucose. However, conventional growth models focus almost exclusively on glucose uptake. Here we present results from growth-rate experiments that cannot be explained by focusing on glucose uptake alone. By imposing a glucose uptake rate independent of the sensed extracellular glucose level, we show that despite increasing both the sensed glucose concentration and uptake rate, the cell's growth rate can decrease or even approach zero. We resolve this puzzle by showing that the interaction between glucose perception and import, not their individual actions, determines the central features of growth, and characterize this interaction using a quantitative model. Disrupting this interaction by knocking out two key glucose sensors significantly changes the cell's growth rate, yet uptake rates are unchanged. This is due to a decrease in burden that glucose perception places on the cells. Our work shows that glucose perception and import are separate and pivotal modules of yeast growth, the interaction of which can be precisely tuned and measured.},

@article{Pradelli2010,
abstract = {Most cancer cells exhibit increased glycolysis for generation of their energy supply. This specificity could be used to preferentially kill these cells. In this study, we identified the signaling pathway initiated by glycolysis inhibition that results in sensitization to death receptor (DR)-induced apoptosis. We showed, in several human cancer cell lines (such as Jurkat, HeLa, U937), that glucose removal or the use of nonmetabolizable form of glucose (2-deoxyglucose) dramatically enhances apoptosis induced by Fas or by tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand. This sensitization is controlled through the adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which is the central energy-sensing system of the cell. We established the fact that AMPK is activated upon glycolysis block resulting in mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibition leading to Mcl-1 decrease, but no other Bcl-2 anti-apoptotic members. Interestingly, we determined that, upon glycolysis inhibition, the AMPK-mTOR pathway controlled Mcl-1 levels neither through transcriptional nor through posttranslational mechanism but rather by controlling its translation. Therefore, our results show a novel mechanism for the sensitization to DR-induced apoptosis linking glucose metabolism to Mcl-1 downexpression. In addition, this study provides a rationale for the combined use of DR ligands with AMPK activators or mTOR inhibitors in the treatment of human cancers.},

Many experimental results and numerical results have shown the validity of the assumption. So, an important problem is if it is always true. If it is always true, then it should be a law, not only an assumption. In this paper, we prove mathematically rigorously that it is indeed always true. Hence, it is a law, and we name it the Quasi-Steady-State Law. Actually, more precisely, we have two Quasi-Steady-State Laws. In one of them quasi-steady state means that the concentration of the enzyme-substrate complex remains approximately constant, and in the other it means that the change rate of the concentration of enzyme-substrate complex is extremely tiny.},

@article{Wagner1996,
abstract = {e problem of complex adaptations is studied in two largely disconnected research traditions: evolutionary biology and evolutionary computer science. This paper summarizes the results from both areas and compares their implications. In evolutionary computer science it was found that the Darwinian process of mutation, recombination and selection is not universally effective in improving complex systems like computer programs or chip designs. For adaptation to occur, these systems must possess "evolvability," i.e., the ability of random variations to sometimes produce improvement. It was found that evolvability critically depends on the way genetic variation maps onto phenotypic variation, an issue known as the representation problem. The genotype-phenotype map determines the variability of characters, which is the propensity to vary. Variability needs to be distinguished from variations, which are the actually realized differences between individuals. The genotype-phenotype map is the common theme underlying such varied biological phenomena as genetic canalization, developmental constraints, biological versatility, devel- opmental dissociability, and morphological integration. For evolutionary biology the representation problem has im- portant implications: how is it that extant species acquired a genotype-phenotype map which allows improvement by mutation and selection? Is the genotype-phenotype map able to change in evolution? What are the selective forces, if any, that shape the genotype-phenotype map? We propose that the genotype-phenotype map can evolve by two main routes: epistatic mutations, or the creation of new genes. A common result for organismic design is modularity. By modularity we mean a genotype-phenotype map in which there are few pleiotropic effects among characters serving different functions, with pleiotropic effects falling mainly among characters that are part of a single functional complex. Such a design is expected to improve evolvability by limiting the interference between the adaptation of different functions. Several population genetic models are reviewed that are intended to explain the evolutionary origin of a modular design. While our current knowledge is insufficient to assess the plausibility of these models, they form the beginning of a framework for understanding the evolution of the genotype-phenotype map},

abstract = {Epistatic interactions between mutations play a prominent role in evolutionary theories. Many studies have found that epistasis is widespread, but they have rarely considered beneficial mutations. We analyzed the effects of epistasis on fitness for the first five mutations to fix in an experimental population of Escherichia coli. Epistasis depended on the effects of the combined mutations--the larger the expected benefit, the more negative the epistatic effect. Epistasis thus tended to produce diminishing returns with genotype fitness, although interactions involving one particular mutation had the opposite effect. These data support models in which negative epistasis contributes to declining rates of adaptation over time. Sign epistasis was rare in this genome-wide study, in contrast to its prevalence in an earlier study of mutations in a single gene.},

@article{Behre2008,
abstract = {We present a generalised framework for analysing structural robustness of metabolic networks, based on the concept of elementary flux modes (EFMs). Extending our earlier study on single knockouts [Wilhelm, T., Behre, J., Schuster, S., 2004. Analysis of structural robustness of metabolic networks. IEE Proc. Syst. Biol. 1(1), 114-120], we are now considering the general case of double and multiple knockouts. The robustness measures are based on the ratio of the number of remaining EFMs after knockout vs. the number of EFMs in the unperturbed situation, averaged over all combinations of knockouts. With the help of simple examples we demonstrate that consideration of multiple knockouts yields additional information going beyond single-knockout results. It is proven that the robustness score decreases as the knockout depth increases. We apply our extended framework to metabolic networks representing amino acid anabolism in Escherichia coli and human hepatocytes, and the central metabolism in human erythrocytes. Moreover, in the E. coli model the two subnetworks synthesising amino acids that are essential and those that are non-essential for humans are studied separately. The results are discussed from an evolutionary viewpoint. We find that E. coli has the most robust metabolism of all the cell types studied here. Considering only the subnetwork of the synthesis of non-essential amino acids, E. coli and the human hepatocyte show about the same robustness.},

abstract = {Epistasis and the evolution of recombination are closely intertwined: epistasis generates linkage disequilibria (i.e. statistical associations between alleles), whereas recombination breaks them up. The mutational deterministic hypothesis (MDH) states that high recombination rates are maintained because the breaking up of linkage disequilibria generated by negative epistasis enables more efficient purging of deleterious mutations. However, recent theoretical and experimental work challenges the MDH. Experimental evidence suggests that negative epistasis, required by the MDH, is relatively uncommon. On the theoretical side, population genetic models suggest that, compared with the combined effects of drift and selection, epistasis generates a negligible amount of linkage disequilibria. Here, we assess these criticisms and discuss to what extent they invalidate the MDH as an explanation for the evolution of recombination.},

abstract = {The relationship between rates of genomic evolution and organismal adaptation remains uncertain, despite considerable interest. The feasibility of obtaining genome sequences from experimentally evolving populations offers the opportunity to investigate this relationship with new precision. Here we sequence genomes sampled through 40,000 generations from a laboratory population of Escherichia coli. Although adaptation decelerated sharply, genomic evolution was nearly constant for 20,000 generations. Such clock-like regularity is usually viewed as the signature of neutral evolution, but several lines of evidence indicate that almost all of these mutations were beneficial. This same population later evolved an elevated mutation rate and accumulated hundreds of additional mutations dominated by a neutral signature. Thus, the coupling between genomic and adaptive evolution is complex and can be counterintuitive even in a constant environment. In particular, beneficial substitutions were surprisingly uniform over time, whereas neutral substitutions were highly variable.},

@article{Aledo2008,
abstract = {In yeast, a sudden transition from glucose limitation to glucose excess leads to a new steady state at increased metabolic fluxes with a sustained decrease in the ATP concentration. Although this behaviour has been rationalized as an adaptive metabolic strategy, the mechanism behind it remains unclear. Nevertheless, it is thought that, on glucose addition, a metabolite derived from glycolysis may up-regulate ATP-consuming reactions. The adenine nucleotides themselves have been ruled out as the signals that mediate this regulation. This is mainly because, in that case, it would be expected that the new steady state at increased fluxes would be accompanied by an increased stationary ATP concentration. In this study, we present a core model consisting of a monocyclic interconvertible enzyme system. Using a supply-demand approach, we demonstrate that this system can account for the empirical observations without involving metabolites other than the adenine nucleotides as effectors. Moreover, memory is an emerging property of such a system, which may allow the cell to sense both the current energy status and the direction of the changes.},

The network encompassed 478 proteins, of which 120 were determined by experiment and 358 were modeled. Structural analysis revealed that proteins forming the network are dominated by a small number (only 182) of basic shapes (folds) performing diverse but mostly related functions. Most of these folds are already present in the essential core (approximately 30\%) of the network, and its expansion by nonessential proteins is achieved with relatively few additional folds. Thus, integration of structural data with networks analysis generates insight into the function, mechanism, and evolution of biological networks.},

abstract = {Complete modeling of metabolic networks is desirable, but it is difficult to accomplish because of the lack of kinetics. As a step toward this goal, we have developed an approach to build an ensemble of dynamic models that reach the same steady state. The models in the ensemble are based on the same mechanistic framework at the elementary reaction level, including known regulations, and span the space of all kinetics allowable by thermodynamics. This ensemble allows for the examination of possible phenotypes of the network upon perturbations, such as changes in enzyme expression levels. The size of the ensemble is reduced by acquiring data for such perturbation phenotypes. If the mechanistic framework is approximately accurate, the ensemble converges to a smaller set of models and becomes more predictive. This approach bypasses the need for detailed characterization of kinetic parameters and arrives at a set of models that describes relevant phenotypes upon enzyme perturbations.},

abstract = {Growth at near-zero specific growth rates is a largely unexplored area of yeast physiology. To investigate the physiology of Saccharomyces cerevisiae under these conditions, the effluent removal pipe of anaerobic, glucose-limited chemostat culture (dilution rate, 0.025 h(-1)) was fitted with a 0.22-microm-pore-size polypropylene filter unit. This setup enabled prolonged cultivation with complete cell retention. After 22 days of cultivation, specific growth rates had decreased below 0.001 h(-1) (doubling time of >700 h). Over this period, viability of the retentostat cultures decreased to ca. 80\%. The viable biomass concentration in the retentostats could be accurately predicted by a maintenance coefficient of 0.50 mmol of glucose g(-1) of biomass h(-1) calculated from anaerobic, glucose-limited chemostat cultures grown at dilution rates of 0.025 to 0.20 h(-1). This indicated that, in contrast to the situation in several prokaryotes, maintenance energy requirements in S. cerevisiae do not substantially change at near-zero specific growth rates. After 22 days of retentostat cultivation, glucose metabolism was predominantly geared toward alcoholic fermentation to meet maintenance energy requirements. The strict correlation between glycerol production and biomass formation observed at higher specific growth rates was not maintained at the near-zero growth rates reached in the retentostat cultures. In addition to glycerol, the organic acids acetate, d-lactate, and succinate were produced at low rates during prolonged retentostat cultivation. This study identifies robustness and by-product formation as key issues in attempts to uncouple growth and product formation in S. cerevisiae.},

We show that compartmental pH is an important determinant of thermodynamically determined reaction directionality. The effects of pH on transport reaction thermodynamics are only seen to their full extent when metabolites are represented as pseudoisomer groups of multiple protonated species. We accurately predict the irreversibility of 387 reactions, with detailed propagation of uncertainty in input data, and manually curate the literature to resolve conflicting directionality assignments. In at least half of all cases, a prediction of a reversible reaction directionality is due to the paucity of compartment-specific quantitative metabolomic data, with remaining cases due to uncertainty in estimation of standard reaction Gibbs energy. This study points to the pressing need for 1), quantitative metabolomic data, and 2), experimental measurement of thermochemical properties for human metabolites.},

The conversion of this metabolic network reconstruction into an in silico model is detailed. A new step in the metabolic reconstruction process, termed thermodynamic consistency analysis, is introduced, in which reactions were checked for consistency with thermodynamic reversibility estimates.

In COBRA, extreme pathway and optimization analyses are commonly used to study the properties of networks. While the results of both methods are completely consistent, extreme pathway analysis is considered to be better because of its wider representational ability. In this study, we assessed these two methods by computational knockout experiments. We examined a simple pathway model and found that the extreme pathway method led to misguided conclusions in specific cases, while optimization analysis calculated the correct knockout effects. We also investigated the Escherichia coli metabolic pathway model, and found that these methods result in inconsistent interpretations of the network properties. IN CONCLUSION: it has been claimed that these two methods result in the same producible metabolites, but we found a difference in individual results for a biological pathway.

abstract = {MOTIVATION: We introduce a novel approach to multiple alignment that is based on an algorithm for rapidly checking whether single matches are consistent with a partial multiple alignment. This leads to a sequence annealing algorithm, which is an incremental method for building multiple sequence alignments one match at a time. Our approach improves significantly on the standard progressive alignment approach to multiple alignment. RESULTS: The sequence annealing algorithm performs well on benchmark test sets of protein sequences. It is not only sensitive, but also specific, drastically reducing the number of incorrectly aligned residues in comparison to other programs. The method allows for adjustment of the sensitivity/specificity tradeoff and can be used to reliably identify homologous regions among protein sequences. AVAILABILITY: An implementation of the sequence annealing algorithm is available at http://bio.math.berkeley.edu/amap/},

abstract = {Genomic data allow the large-scale manual or semi-automated assembly of metabolic network reconstructions, which provide highly curated organism-specific knowledge bases. Although several genome-scale network reconstructions describe Saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolism, they differ in scope and content, and use different terminologies to describe the same chemical entities. This makes comparisons between them difficult and underscores the desirability of a consolidated metabolic network that collects and formalizes the 'community knowledge' of yeast metabolism. We describe how we have produced a consensus metabolic network reconstruction for S. cerevisiae. In drafting it, we placed special emphasis on referencing molecules to persistent databases or using database-independent forms, such as SMILES or InChI strings, as this permits their chemical structure to be represented unambiguously and in a manner that permits automated reasoning. The reconstruction is readily available via a publicly accessible database and in the Systems Biology Markup Language (http://www.comp-sys-bio.org/yeastnet). It can be maintained as a resource that serves as a common denominator for studying the systems biology of yeast. Similar strategies should benefit communities studying genome-scale metabolic networks of other organisms.},

abstract = {The energy-metabolism oscillation in aerobic chemostat cultures of yeast is a periodic change of the respiro-fermentative and respiratory phase. In the respiro-fermentative phase, the NADH level was kept high and respiration was suppressed, and glucose was anabolized into trehalose and glycogen at a rate comparable to that of catabolism. On the transition to the respiratory phase, cAMP levels increased triggering the breakdown of storage carbohydrates and the increased influx of glucose into the glycolytic pathway activated production of glycerol and ethanol consuming NADH. The resulting increase in the NAD(+)/NADH ratio stimulated respiration in combination with a decrease in the level of ATP, which was consumed mainly in the formation of biomass accompanying budding, and the accumulated ethanol and glycerol were gradually degraded by respiration via NAD(+)-dependent oxidation to acetate and the respiratory phase ceased after the recovery of NADH and ATP levels. However, the mRNA levels of both synthetic and degradative enzymes of storage carbohydrates were increased around the early respiro-fermentative phase, when storage carbohydrates are being synthesized, suggesting that the synthetic enzymes were expressed directly as active forms while the degradative enzymes were activated late by cAMP. In summary, the energy-metabolism oscillation is basically regulated by a feedback loop of oxido-reductive reactions of energy metabolism mediated by metabolites like NADH and ATP, and is modulated by metabolism of storage carbohydrates in combination of post-translational and transcriptional regulation of the related enzymes. A potential mechanism of energy-metabolism oscillation is proposed.},

Here, we tested whether <italic>R. rosea</italic> might act through a pathway related to dietary restriction (DR) that can extend lifespan in a range of model organisms. While the mechanism of DR itself is also unknown, three molecular pathways have been associated with it: the silent information regulator 2 (SIR2) proteins, insulin and insulin-like growth factor signaling (IIS), and the target of rapamycin (TOR). In flies, DR is implemented through a reduction in dietary yeast content. We found that <italic>R. rosea</italic> extract extended lifespan in both sexes independent of the yeast content in the diet. We also found that the extract extended lifespan when the SIR2, IIS, or TOR pathways were genetically perturbed. Upon examination of water and fat content, we found that <italic>R. rosea</italic> decreased water content and elevated fat content in both sexes, but did not sensitize flies to desiccation or protect them against starvation. There were some sex-specific differences in response to <italic>R. rosea</italic>.

Epistasis (the interaction between alleles at different loci), especially epistasis for fitness traits such as reproduction and survival, influences evolutionary predictions "almost whenever multilocus genetics matters". Yet very few models have sought to predict epistasis, and none has been empirically tested. Here we show that the distribution of epistasis can be predicted from the distribution of single mutation effects, based on a simple fitness landscape model. We show that this prediction closely matches the empirical measures of epistasis that have been obtained for Escherichia coli and the RNA virus vesicular stomatitis virus. Our results suggest that a simple fitness landscape model may be sufficient to quantitatively capture the complex nature of gene interactions. This model may offer a simple and widely applicable alternative to complex metabolic network models, in particular for making evolutionary predictions.},

abstract = {Dietary restriction delays the incidence and decreases the growth of various types of tumours, but the mechanisms underlying the sensitivity of tumours to food restriction remain unknown. Here we show that certain human cancer cell lines, when grown as tumour xenografts in mice, are highly sensitive to the anti-growth effects of dietary restriction, whereas others are resistant. Cancer cells that form dietary-restriction-resistant tumours carry mutations that cause constitutive activation of the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) pathway and in culture proliferate in the absence of insulin or insulin-like growth factor 1. Substitution of an activated mutant allele of PI3K with wild-type PI3K in otherwise isogenic cancer cells, or the restoration of PTEN expression in a PTEN-null cancer cell line, is sufficient to convert a dietary-restriction-resistant tumour into one that is dietary-restriction-sensitive. Dietary restriction does not affect a PTEN-null mouse model of prostate cancer, but it significantly decreases tumour burden in a mouse model of lung cancer lacking constitutive PI3K signalling. Thus, the PI3K pathway is an important determinant of the sensitivity of tumours to dietary restriction, and activating mutations in the pathway may influence the response of cancers to dietary restriction-mimetic therapies.},

abstract = {An increasing number of algorithms for biochemical network inference from experimental data require discrete data as input. For example, dynamic Bayesian network methods and methods that use the framework of finite dynamical systems, such as Boolean networks, all take discrete input. Experimental data, however, are typically continuous and represented by computer floating point numbers. The translation from continuous to discrete data is crucial in preserving the variable dependencies and thus has a significant impact on the performance of the network inference algorithms. We compare the performance of two such algorithms that use discrete data using several different discretization algorithms. One of the inference methods uses a dynamic Bayesian network framework, the other-a time-and state-discrete dynamical system framework. The discretization algorithms are quantile, interval discretization, and a new algorithm introduced in this article, SSD. SSD is especially designed for short time series data and is capable of determining the optimal number of discretization states. The experiments show that both inference methods perform better with SSD than with the other methods. In addition, SSD is demonstrated to preserve the dynamic features of the time series, as well as to be robust to noise in the experimental data. A C++ implementation of SSD is available from the authors at http://polymath.vbi.vt.edu/discretization .},

Serum starvation is one of the most frequently performed procedures in molecular biology and there are literally thousands of research papers reporting its use. In fact, this method has become so ingrained in certain areas of research that reports often simply state that cells were serum starved without providing any factual details as to how the procedure was carried out. Even so, we quite obviously lack unequivocal terminology, standard protocols, and perhaps most surprisingly, a common conceptual basis when performing serum starvation. Such inconsistencies not only hinder interstudy comparability but can lead to opposing and inconsistent experimental results. Although it is frequently assumed that serum starvation reduces basal activity of cells, available experimental data do not entirely support this notion. To address this important issue, we studied primary human myotubes, rat L6 myotubes and human embryonic kidney (HEK)293 cells under different serum starvation conditions and followed time-dependent changes in important signaling pathways such as the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2, the AMP-activated protein kinase, and the mammalian target of rapamycin. Serum starvation induced a swift and dynamic response, which displayed obvious qualitative and quantitative differences across different cell types and experimental conditions despite certain unifying features. There was no uniform reduction in basal signaling activity. Serum starvation clearly represents a major event that triggers a plethora of divergent responses and has therefore great potential to interfere with the experimental results and affect subsequent conclusions.serum-free mediumbasal phosphorylationAMP-activated protein kinasemammalian target of rapamycinextracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2Copyright © 2011 the American Physiological Society},

abstract = {Examples of metabolic rhythms have recently emerged from studies of budding yeast. High density microarray analyses have produced a remarkably detailed picture of cycling gene expression that could be clustered according to metabolic functions. We developed a model-based approach for the decomposition of expression to analyze these data and to identify functional modules which, expressed sequentially and periodically, contribute to the complex and intricate mitochondrial architecture. This approach revealed that mitochondrial spatio-temporal modules are expressed during periodic spikes and specific cellular localizations, which cover the entire oscillatory period. For instance, assembly factors (32 genes) and translation regulators (47 genes) are expressed earlier than the components of the amino-acid synthesis pathways (31 genes). In addition, we could correlate the expression modules identified with particular post-transcriptional properties. Thus, mRNAs of modules expressed "early" are mostly translated in the vicinity of mitochondria under the control of the Puf3p mRNA-binding protein. This last spatio-temporal module concerns mostly mRNAs coding for basic elements of mitochondrial construction: assembly and regulatory factors. Prediction that unknown genes from this module code for important elements of mitochondrial biogenesis is supported by experimental evidence. More generally, these observations underscore the importance of post-transcriptional processes in mitochondrial biogenesis, highlighting close connections between nuclear transcription and cytoplasmic site-specific translation.},

abstract = {Like phosphorylation, the addition of O-linked beta-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAcylation) is a ubiquitous, reversible process that modifies serine and threonine residues on nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins. Overexpression of the enzyme that adds O-GlcNAc to target proteins, O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT), perturbs cytokinesis and promotes polyploidy, but the molecular targets of OGT that are important for its cell cycle functions are unknown. Here, we identify 141 previously unknown O-GlcNAc sites on proteins that function in spindle assembly and cytokinesis. Many of these O-GlcNAcylation sites are either identical to known phosphorylation sites or in close proximity to them. Furthermore, we found that O-GlcNAcylation altered the phosphorylation of key proteins associated with the mitotic spindle and midbody. Forced overexpression of OGT increased the inhibitory phosphorylation of cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) and reduced the phosphorylation of CDK1 target proteins. The increased phosphorylation of CDK1 is explained by increased activation of its upstream kinase, MYT1, and by a concomitant reduction in the transcript for the CDK1 phosphatase, CDC25C. OGT overexpression also caused a reduction in both messenger RNA expression and protein abundance of Polo-like kinase 1, which is upstream of both MYT1 and CDC25C. The data not only illustrate the crosstalk between O-GlcNAcylation and phosphorylation of proteins that are regulators of crucial signaling pathways but also uncover a mechanism for the role of O-GlcNAcylation in regulation of cell division.},

abstract = {<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>The fact that functionally more important genes or DNA sequences evolve more slowly than less important ones is commonly believed and frequently used by molecular biologists. However, previous genome-wide studies of a diverse array of organisms found only weak, negative correlations between the importance of a gene and its evolutionary rate. We show, here, that the weakness of the correlation is not because gene importance measured in lab conditions deviates from that in an organism's natural environments. Neither is it due to a potentially biased among-gene distribution of functional density. We suggest that the weakness of the correlation is factual, rather than artifactual. These findings notwithstanding, we show that the principle of slower evolution of more important genes does have some predictive power when genes with vastly different evolutionary rates are compared, explaining why the principle can be practically useful for tasks such as identifying functional non-coding sequences despite the weakness of the correlation.</p>

abstract = {Genome-scale metabolic networks can now be reconstructed based on annotated genomic data augmented with biochemical and physiological information about the organism. Mathematical analysis can be performed to assess the capabilities of these reconstructed networks. The constraints-based framework, with flux balance analysis (FBA), has been used successfully to predict time course of growth and by-product secretion, effects of mutation and knock-outs, and gene expression profiles. However, FBA leads to incorrect predictions in situations where regulatory effects are a dominant influence on the behavior of the organism. Thus, there is a need to include regulatory events within FBA to broaden its scope and predictive capabilities. Here we represent transcriptional regulatory events as time-dependent constraints on the capabilities of a reconstructed metabolic network to further constrain the space of possible network functions. Using a simplified metabolic/regulatory network, growth is simulated under various conditions to illustrate systemic effects such as catabolite repression, the aerobic/anaerobic diauxic shift and amino acid biosynthesis pathway repression. The incorporation of transcriptional regulatory events in FBA enables us to interpret, analyse and predict the effects of transcriptional regulation on cellular metabolism at the systemic level.},

abstract = {Circulating tumour cells (CTCs) shed into blood from primary cancers include putative precursors that initiate distal metastases. Although these cells are extraordinarily rare, they may identify cellular pathways contributing to the blood-borne dissemination of cancer. Here, we adapted a microfluidic device for efficient capture of CTCs from an endogenous mouse pancreatic cancer model and subjected CTCs to single-molecule RNA sequencing, identifying Wnt2 as a candidate gene enriched in CTCs. Expression of WNT2 in pancreatic cancer cells suppresses anoikis, enhances anchorage-independent sphere formation, and increases metastatic propensity in vivo. This effect is correlated with fibronectin upregulation and suppressed by inhibition of MAP3K7 (also known as TAK1) kinase. In humans, formation of non-adherent tumour spheres by pancreatic cancer cells is associated with upregulation of multiple WNT genes, and pancreatic CTCs revealed enrichment for WNT signalling in 5 out of 11 cases. Thus, molecular analysis of CTCs may identify candidate therapeutic targets to prevent the distal spread of cancer.},

abstract = {Identifying the forces responsible for the origin and maintenance of sexuality remains one of the greatest unsolved problems in biology. The mutational deterministic hypothesis postulates that sex is an adaptation that allows deleterious mutations to be purged from the genome; it requires synergistic interactions, which means that two mutations would be more harmful together than expected from their separate effects. We generated 225 genotypes of Escherichia coli carrying one, two or three successive mutations and measured their fitness relative to an unmutated competitor. The relationship between mutation number and average fitness is nearly log-linear. We also constructed 27 recombinant genotypes having pairs of mutations whose separate and combined effects on fitness were determined. Several pairs exhibit significant interactions for fitness, but they are antagonistic as often as they are synergistic. These results do not support the mutational deterministic hypothesis for the evolution of sex.},

@article{Segre2005,
abstract = {Epistatic interactions, manifested in the effects of mutations on the phenotypes caused by other mutations, may help uncover the functional organization of complex biological networks. Here, we studied system-level epistatic interactions by computing growth phenotypes of all single and double knockouts of 890 metabolic genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, using the framework of flux balance analysis. A new scale for epistasis identified a distinctive trimodal distribution of these epistatic effects, allowing gene pairs to be classified as buffering, aggravating or noninteracting. We found that the ensuing epistatic interaction network could be organized hierarchically into function-enriched modules that interact with each other 'monochromatically' (i.e., with purely aggravating or purely buffering epistatic links). This property extends the concept of epistasis from single genes to functional units and provides a new definition of biological modularity, which emphasizes interactions between, rather than within, functional modules. Our approach can be used to infer functional gene modules from purely phenotypic epistasis measurements.},

abstract = {Biological systems often display modularity, in the sense that they can be decomposed into nearly independent subsystems. Recent studies have suggested that modular structure can spontaneously emerge if goals (environments) change over time, such that each new goal shares the same set of sub-problems with previous goals. Such modularly varying goals can also dramatically speed up evolution, relative to evolution under a constant goal. These studies were based on simulations of model systems, such as logic circuits and RNA structure, which are generally not easy to treat analytically. We present, here, a simple model for evolution under modularly varying goals that can be solved analytically. This model helps to understand some of the fundamental mechanisms that lead to rapid emergence of modular structure under modularly varying goals. In particular, the model suggests a mechanism for the dramatic speedup in evolution observed under such temporally varying goals.},

abstract = {Flux balance analysis (FBA) provides a framework for the estimation of intracellular fluxes and energy balance analysis (EBA) ensures the thermodynamic feasibility of the computed optimal fluxes. Previously, these techniques have been used to obtain optimal fluxes that maximize a single objective. Because mammalian systems perform various functions, a multi-objective approach is needed when seeking optimal flux distributions in such systems. For example, hepatocytes perform several metabolic functions at various levels depending on environmental conditions; furthermore, there is a potential benefit to enhance some of these functions for applications such as bioartificial liver (BAL) support devices. Herein we developed a multi-objective optimization approach that couples the normalized Normal Constraint (NC) with both FBA and EBA to obtain multi-objective Pareto-optimal solutions. We investigated the Pareto frontiers in gluconeogenic and glycolytic hepatocytes for various combinations of liver-specific objectives (albumin synthesis, glutathione synthesis, NADPH synthesis, ATP generation, and urea secretion). Next, we evaluated the impact of experimental flux measurements on the Pareto frontiers. We found that measurements induce dramatic changes in Pareto frontiers and further constrain the network fluxes. This multi-objective optimality analysis may help explain certain features of the metabolic control of hepatocytes, which is relevant to the response to hepatocytes and liver to various physiological stimuli and disease states.},

abstract = {The interest in studying metabolic alterations in cancer and their potential role as novel targets for therapy has been rejuvenated in recent years. Here, we report the development of the first genome-scale network model of cancer metabolism, validated by correctly identifying genes essential for cellular proliferation in cancer cell lines. The model predicts 52 cytostatic drug targets, of which 40\% are targeted by known, approved or experimental anticancer drugs, and the rest are new. It further predicts combinations of synthetic lethal drug targets, whose synergy is validated using available drug efficacy and gene expression measurements across the NCI-60 cancer cell line collection. Finally, potential selective treatments for specific cancers that depend on cancer type-specific downregulation of gene expression and somatic mutations are compiled.},

abstract = {Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) functions as a second messenger that can activate cell proliferation through chemoselective oxidation of cysteine residues in signaling proteins. The connection between H2O2 signaling, thiol oxidation, and activation of growth pathways has emerged as fertile ground for the development of strategies for cancer treatment. Central to achieving this goal is the development of tools and assays that facilitate characterization of the molecular events associated with tumorigenesis and evaluation of patient response to therapy. Here we report on the development of an immunochemical method for detecting sulfenic acid, the initial oxidation product that results when a thiolate reacts with H2O2. For this approach, the sulfenic acid is derivatized with a chemical tag to generate a unique epitope for recognition. The elicited antibody is exquisitely specific, context-independent, and capable of visualizing sulfenic acid formation in cells. Applying this approach to several systems, including cancer cell lines, shows it can be used to monitor differences in thiol redox status and reveals a diverse pattern of sulfenic acid modifications across different subtypes of breast tumors. These studies demonstrate a general strategy for producing antibodies against a specific oxidation state of cysteine and show the utility of these reagents for profiling thiol oxidation associated with pathological conditions such as breast cancer.},

abstract = {We describe the use of model-driven analysis of multiple data types relevant to transcriptional regulation of metabolism to discover novel regulatory mechanisms in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We have reconstructed the nutrient-controlled transcriptional regulatory network controlling metabolism in S. cerevisiae consisting of 55 transcription factors regulating 750 metabolic genes, based on information in the primary literature. This reconstructed regulatory network coupled with an existing genome-scale metabolic network model allows in silico prediction of growth phenotypes of regulatory gene deletions as well as gene expression profiles. We compared model predictions of gene expression changes in response to genetic and environmental perturbations to experimental data to identify potential novel targets for transcription factors. We then identified regulatory cascades connecting transcription factors to the potential targets through a systematic model expansion strategy using published genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation and binding-site-motif data sets. Finally, we show the ability of an integrated metabolic and regulatory network model to predict growth phenotypes of transcription factor knockout strains. These studies illustrate the potential of model-driven data integration to systematically discover novel components and interactions in regulatory and metabolic networks in eukaryotic cells.},

The global network identifies functional cross-connections between all bioprocesses, mapping a cellular wiring diagram of pleiotropy.

@article{Frick2005,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: One of the most fascinating properties of the biotechnologically important organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae is its ability to perform simultaneous respiration and fermentation at high growth rate even under fully aerobic conditions. In the present work, this Crabtree effect called phenomenon was investigated in detail by comparative 13C metabolic flux analysis of S. cerevisiae growing under purely oxidative, respiro-fermentative and predominantly fermentative conditions. RESULTS: The metabolic shift from oxidative to fermentative growth was accompanied by complex changes of carbon flux throughout the whole central metabolism. This involved a flux redirection from the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) towards glycolysis, an increased flux through pyruvate carboxylase, the fermentative pathways and malic enzyme, a flux decrease through the TCA cycle, and a partial relocation of alanine biosynthesis from the mitochondrion to the cytosol. S. cerevisiae exhibited a by-pass of pyruvate dehydrogenase in all physiological regimes. During oxidative growth this by-pass was mainly provided via pyruvate decarboxylase, acetaldehyde dehydrogenase, acetyl-CoA synthase and transport of acetyl-CoA into the mitochondrion. During fermentative growth this route, however, was saturated due to limited enzyme capacity. Under these conditions the cells exhibited high carbon flux through a chain of reactions involving pyruvate carboxylase, the oxaloacetate transporter and malic enzyme. During purely oxidative growth the PPP alone was sufficient to completely supply NADPH for anabolism. During fermentation, it provided only 60 \% of the required NADPH. CONCLUSION: We conclude that, in order to overcome the limited capacity of pyruvate dehydrogenase, S. cerevisiae possesses different metabolic by-passes to channel carbon into the mitochondrion. This involves the conversion of cytosolic pyruvate either into acetyl CoA or oxaloacetate followed by intercompartmental transport of these metabolites. During oxidative growth mainly the NAD specific isoforms of acetaldehyde dehydrogenase and isocitrate dehydrogenase catalyze the corresponding reactions in S. cerevisiae, whereas NADPH supply under fermentative conditions involves significant contribution of sources other than the PPP such as e. g. NADPH specific acetaldehyde dehydrogenase or isocitrate dehydrogenase.},

@article{Breen2012,
abstract = {The main forces directing long-term molecular evolution remain obscure. A sizable fraction of amino-acid substitutions seem to be fixed by positive selection, but it is unclear to what degree long-term protein evolution is constrained by epistasis, that is, instances when substitutions that are accepted in one genotype are deleterious in another. Here we obtain a quantitative estimate of the prevalence of epistasis in long-term protein evolution by relating data on amino-acid usage in 14 organelle proteins and 2 nuclear-encoded proteins to their rates of short-term evolution. We studied multiple alignments of at least 1,000 orthologues for each of these 16 proteins from species from a diverse phylogenetic background and found that an average site contained approximately eight different amino acids. Thus, without epistasis an average site should accept two-fifths of all possible amino acids, and the average rate of amino-acid substitutions should therefore be about three-fifths lower than the rate of neutral evolution. However, we found that the measured rate of amino-acid substitution in recent evolution is 20 times lower than the rate of neutral evolution and an order of magnitude lower than that expected in the absence of epistasis. These data indicate that epistasis is pervasive throughout protein evolution: about 90 per cent of all amino-acid substitutions have a neutral or beneficial impact only in the genetic backgrounds in which they occur, and must therefore be deleterious in a different background of other species. Our findings show that most amino-acid substitutions have different fitness effects in different species and that epistasis provides the primary conceptual framework to describe the tempo and mode of long-term protein evolution.},

abstract = {The integration of various types of genomic data into predictive models of biological networks is one of the main challenges currently faced by computational biology. Constraint-based models in particular play a key role in the attempt to obtain a quantitative understanding of cellular metabolism at genome scale. In essence, their goal is to frame the metabolic capabilities of an organism based on minimal assumptions that describe the steady states of the underlying reaction network via suitable stoichiometric constraints, specifically mass balance and energy balance (i.e. thermodynamic feasibility). The implementation of these requirements to generate viable configurations of reaction fluxes and/or to test given flux profiles for thermodynamic feasibility can however prove to be computationally intensive. We propose here a fast and scalable stoichiometry-based method to explore the Gibbs energy landscape of a biochemical network at steady state. The method is applied to the problem of reconstructing the Gibbs energy landscape underlying metabolic activity in the human red blood cell, and to that of identifying and removing thermodynamically infeasible reaction cycles in the Escherichia coli metabolic network (iAF1260). In the former case, we produce consistent predictions for chemical potentials (or log-concentrations) of intracellular metabolites; in the latter, we identify a restricted set of loops (23 in total) in the periplasmic and cytoplasmic core as the origin of thermodynamic infeasibility in a large sample (10(6)) of flux configurations generated randomly and compatibly with the prior information available on reaction reversibility.},

abstract = {The ability of Pseudomonas syringae to grow and cause diseases in plants is dependent on the injection of multiple effector proteins into plant cells via the type III secretion system (T3SS). Genome-enabled bioinformatic/experimental methods have comprehensively identified the repertoires of effectors and related T3SS substrates for P. syringae pv. tomato DC3000 and three other sequenced strains. The effector repertoires are diverse and internally redundant. Insights into effector functions are being gained through the construction of mutants lacking one or more effector genes, which may be reduced in growth in planta, and through gain-of-function assays for the ability of single effectors to suppress plant innate immune defenses, manipulate hormone signaling, elicit cell death, and/or display biochemical activities on plant protein targets.},

abstract = {Red wine contains antioxidants and is at moderate amounts believed to exert certain positive health effects. Resveratrol is one of the most studied antioxidants in red wine and has been suggested to activate the longevity- and metabolism-associated histone deacetylase SIRT1. Here we show that relatively low concentrations of resveratrol (0.5-3 microM) specifically inhibited neuronal differentiation of neural stem cells in a SIRT1-dependent manner whereas higher concentrations of resveratrol (> or =10 microM) induced a SIRT1-independent cell death. Surprisingly, using a cell based assay, we found that small amounts of red wine (1-5\% v/v)--but not white wine--induced a massive and rapid cell death of various cell types, including neural stem cells and several cancer cell lines. This red wine-induced cell death was ethanol-, SIRT1- and resveratrol-independent but associated with increased oxidative stress and inhibition of thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) activity. The TrxR inhibition correlated with the red color (absorbance at 520 nm) of the wines demonstrating that pigment components of red wine can exert profound cellular effects. Our results unveil important roles for SIRT1 and TrxR in resveratrol and red wine-mediated effects on progenitor and cancer cells, and demonstrate that cellular responses to red wine may be more complex than generally appreciated.},

abstract = {Protein phosphorylation is estimated to affect 30\% of the proteome and is a major regulatory mechanism that controls many basic cellular processes. Until recently, our biochemical understanding of protein phosphorylation on a global scale has been extremely limited; only one half of the yeast kinases have known in vivo substrates and the phosphorylating kinase is known for less than 160 phosphoproteins. Here we describe, with the use of proteome chip technology, the in vitro substrates recognized by most yeast protein kinases: we identified over 4,000 phosphorylation events involving 1,325 different proteins. These substrates represent a broad spectrum of different biochemical functions and cellular roles. Distinct sets of substrates were recognized by each protein kinase, including closely related kinases of the protein kinase A family and four cyclin-dependent kinases that vary only in their cyclin subunits. Although many substrates reside in the same cellular compartment or belong to the same functional category as their phosphorylating kinase, many others do not, indicating possible new roles for several kinases. Furthermore, integration of the phosphorylation results with protein-protein interaction and transcription factor binding data revealed novel regulatory modules. Our phosphorylation results have been assembled into a first-generation phosphorylation map for yeast. Because many yeast proteins and pathways are conserved, these results will provide insights into the mechanisms and roles of protein phosphorylation in many eukaryotes.},

abstract = {The Warburg effect--a classical hallmark of cancer metabolism--is a counter-intuitive phenomenon in which rapidly proliferating cancer cells resort to inefficient ATP production via glycolysis leading to lactate secretion, instead of relying primarily on more efficient energy production through mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, as most normal cells do. The causes for the Warburg effect have remained a subject of considerable controversy since its discovery over 80 years ago, with several competing hypotheses. Here, utilizing a genome-scale human metabolic network model accounting for stoichiometric and enzyme solvent capacity considerations, we show that the Warburg effect is a direct consequence of the metabolic adaptation of cancer cells to increase biomass production rate. The analysis is shown to accurately capture a three phase metabolic behavior that is observed experimentally during oncogenic progression, as well as a prominent characteristic of cancer cells involving their preference for glutamine uptake over other amino acids.},

abstract = {Analysis of metabolic networks using linear optimization theory allows one to quantify and understand the limitations imposed on the cell by its metabolic stoichiometry, and to understand how the flux through each pathway influences the overall behavior of metabolism. A stoichiometric matrix accounting for the major pathways involved in energy and mass transformations in the cell was used in our analysis. The auxiliary parameters of linear optimization, the so-called shadow prices, identify the intermediates and cofactors that cause the growth to be limited on each nutrient. This formalism was used to examine how well the cell balances its needs for carbon, nitrogen, and energy during growth on different substrates. The relative values of glucose and glutamine as nutrients were compared by varying the ratio of rates of glucose to glutamine uptakes, and calculating the maximum growth rate. The optimum value of this ratio is between 2-7, similar to experimentally observed ratios. The theoretical maximum growth rate was calculated for growth on each amino acid, and the amino acids catabolized directly to glutamate were found to be the optimal nutrients. The importance of each reaction in the network can be examined both by selectively limiting the flux through the reaction, and by the value of the reduced cost for that reaction. Some reactions, such as malic enzyme and glutamate dehydrogenase, may be inhibited or deleted with little or no adverse effect on the calculated cell growth rate.},

@article{Wang2007,
abstract = {Many complex networks such as computer and social networks exhibit modular structures, where links between nodes are much denser within modules than between modules. It is widely believed that cellular networks are also modular, reflecting the relative independence and coherence of different functional units in a cell. While many authors have claimed that observations from the yeast protein-protein interaction (PPI) network support the above hypothesis, the observed structural modularity may be an artifact because the current PPI data include interactions inferred from protein complexes through approaches that create modules (e.g., assigning pairwise interactions among all proteins in a complex). Here we analyze the yeast PPI network including protein complexes (PIC network) and excluding complexes (PEC network). We find that both PIC and PEC networks show a significantly greater structural modularity than that of randomly rewired networks. Nonetheless, there is little evidence that the structural modules correspond to functional units, particularly in the PEC network. More disturbingly, there is no evolutionary conservation among yeast, fly, and nematode modules at either the whole-module or protein-pair level. Neither is there a correlation between the evolutionary or phylogenetic conservation of a protein and the extent of its participation in various modules. Using computer simulation, we demonstrate that a higher-than-expected modularity can arise during network growth through a simple model of gene duplication, without natural selection for modularity. Taken together, our results suggest the intriguing possibility that the structural modules in the PPI network originated as an evolutionary byproduct without biological significance.},

abstract = {The transcription factors responsible for maintaining circadian rhythm influence a variety of biological processes. Recently, it has been suggested that the core circadian genes may play a role in breast tumorigenesis, possibly by influencing hormone regulation or other pathways relevant to cancer. To evaluate this hypothesis, we conducted a genetic and epigenetic association study, as well as a transcriptional profiling array and a pathway-based network analysis. We report significant correlations between single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with the central circadian regulator CLOCK and breast cancer risk, with apparent effect modification by estrogen receptor/progesterone receptor status. We also found that hypermethylation in the CLOCK promoter reduced the risk of breast cancer, and lower levels of CLOCK expression were documented in healthy controls relative to normal or tumor tissue from patients with breast cancer. Finally, we silenced CLOCK in vitro and performed a whole-genome expression microarray and pathway analysis, which identified a cancer-relevant network of transcripts with altered expression following CLOCK gene knockdown. Our findings support the hypothesis that circadian genes influence tumorigenesis, and identify a set of circadian gene variants as candidate breast cancer susceptibility biomarkers.

Herein, using principles of irreversible thermodynamics it was shown that if the ATP-consuming pathways are more sensitive to extracellular glucose than glycolysis, then upon glucose addition glycolysis performance can switch from an efficient working regime to a dissipative regime, and vice versa, depending on glucose availability. The efficient regime represents a good compromise between high output power and low dissipation, whereas the dissipative working regime offers a higher output power although at a high glucose cost.

abstract = {Reversible protein phosphorylation is a signaling mechanism involved in all cellular processes. To create a systems view of the signaling apparatus in budding yeast, we generated an epistatic miniarray profile (E-MAP) comprised of 100,000 pairwise, quantitative genetic interactions, including virtually all protein and small-molecule kinases and phosphatases as well as key cellular regulators. Quantitative genetic interaction mapping reveals factors working in compensatory pathways (negative genetic interactions) or those operating in linear pathways (positive genetic interactions). We found an enrichment of positive genetic interactions between kinases, phosphatases, and their substrates. In addition, we assembled a higher-order map from sets of three genes that display strong interactions with one another: triplets enriched for functional connectivity. The resulting network view provides insights into signaling pathway regulation and reveals a link between the cell-cycle kinase, Cak1, the Fus3 MAP kinase, and a pathway that regulates chromatin integrity during transcription by RNA polymerase II.},

@article{Rosen1983,
abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of extrapolating from data set gathered on a particular system to problems of more general physiological interest. It asks: what are the limits of the extrapolability of data? Under what circumstances can data derived from a particular system be transformed into data about another, different system? Such questions address the general problem of similarity analysis. A mathematical exploration of the meaning and usefulness of the concept of similarity is presented, and the necessity for a "prototype" is introduced. The discussion shows what we mean by the relationship between natural systems and the purest form of model of such systems, the mathematical model. The value and limitations of Dimensional Analysis are considered. It is concluded that the principle of dimensional homogeneity which underlies Dimensional Analysis is not strong enough to cope effectively with situations involving many phases, as arise in biological studies. Therefore, a more general approach is used. It is shown that the problems associated with data extrapolation are very deep and lead to some of the deepest issues in all of science. The extrapolation of data from animal models to human beings has been a general characteristic of pharmacologic research and, for that matter, biomedical investigations generally. Attention to limitations and dangers of such extrapolations seems overdue. With proper understanding of the essential nature of the extrapolatory action, and modeling relations, models can be validated.},

abstract = {The framework Pure Type System (PTS) offers a simple and general approach to designing and formalizing type systems. However, in the presence of dependent types, there often exist some acute problems that make it difficult for PTS to accommodate many common realistic programming features such as general recursion, recursive types, effects (e.g., exceptions, references, input/output), etc. In this paper, we propose a new framework Applied Type System (ATS) to allow for designing and formalizing type systems that can readily support common realistic programming features. The key salient feature of ATS lies in a complete separation between statics, in which types are formed and reasoned about, and dynamics, in which programs are constructed and evaluated. With this separation, it is no longer possible for a program to occur in a type as is otherwise allowed in PTS. We present not only a formal development of ATS but also mention some examples in support of using ATS as a framework to form type systems for practical programming.},

Emphasis is placed on the nearly neutral theory, as this version of the neutral theory has explained the widest range of phenomena. The shift of interest from protein to DNA evolution is chronicled, leading to the modern view that silent and replacement substitutions are responding to different evolutionary forces. However, the exact nature and magnitude of these forces remains controversial, as all current theoretical models suffer either from assumptions that are not quite realistic or from an inability to account readily for all phenomena. Although the gathering of sequence data has been the main effort of contemporary population genetics, further exploration of theoretical models of molecular evolution would provide a more coherent framework for data analysis.},

abstract = {Complex regulatory networks control the transcription state of a genome. These transcriptional regulatory networks (TRNs) have been mathematically described using a Boolean formalism, in which the state of a gene is represented as either transcribed or not transcribed in response to regulatory signals. The Boolean formalism results in a series of regulatory rules for the individual genes of a TRN that in turn can be used to link environmental cues to the transcription state of a genome, thereby forming a complete transcriptional regulatory system (TRS). Herein, we develop a formalism that represents such a set of regulatory rules in a matrix form. Matrix formalism allows for the systemic characterization of the properties of a TRS and facilitates the computation of the transcriptional state of the genome under any given set of environmental conditions. Additionally, it provides a means to incorporate mechanistic detail of a TRS as it becomes available. In this study, the regulatory network matrix, R, for a prototypic TRS is characterized and the fundamental subspaces of this matrix are described. We illustrate how the matrix representation of a TRS coupled with its environment (R*) allows for a sampling of all possible expression states of a given network, and furthermore, how the fundamental subspaces of the matrix provide a way to study key TRS features and may assist in experimental design.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Quantification of intracellular metabolite fluxes by 13C-tracer experiments is maturing into a routine higher-throughput analysis. The question now arises as to which mutants should be analyzed. Here we identify key experiments in a systems biology approach with a genome-scale model of Saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolism, thereby reducing the workload for experimental network analyses and functional genomics. RESULTS: Genome-scale 13C flux analysis revealed that about half of the 745 biochemical reactions were active during growth on glucose, but that alternative pathways exist for only 51 gene-encoded reactions with significant flux. These flexible reactions identified in silico are key targets for experimental flux analysis, and we present the first large-scale metabolic flux data for yeast, covering half of these mutants during growth on glucose. The metabolic lesions were often counteracted by flux rerouting, but knockout of cofactor-dependent reactions, as in the adh1, ald6, cox5A, fum1, mdh1, pda1, and zwf1 mutations, caused flux responses in more distant parts of the network. By integrating computational analyses, flux data, and physiological phenotypes of all mutants in active reactions, we quantified the relative importance of 'genetic buffering' through alternative pathways and network redundancy through duplicate genes for genetic robustness of the network. CONCLUSIONS: The apparent dispensability of knockout mutants with metabolic function is explained by gene inactivity under a particular condition in about half of the cases. For the remaining 207 viable mutants of active reactions, network redundancy through duplicate genes was the major (75\%) and alternative pathways the minor (25\%) molecular mechanism of genetic network robustness in S. cerevisiae.},

Simulating the model in the computer faithfully reproduces the known activity sequence of regulatory proteins along the cell cycle of the living cell. Contrary to existing differential equation models, no parameters enter the model except the structure of the regulatory circuitry. The dynamical properties of the model indicate that the biological dynamical sequence is robustly implemented in the regulatory network, with the biological stationary state G1 corresponding to the dominant attractor in state space, and with the biological regulatory sequence being a strongly attractive trajectory. Comparing the fission yeast cell-cycle model to a similar model of the corresponding network in S. cerevisiae, a remarkable difference in circuitry, as well as dynamics is observed. While the latter operates in a strongly damped mode, driven by external excitation, the S. pombe network represents an auto-excited system with external damping.},

The function of a modified protein is often strongly affected by these modifications and therefore increased knowledge about the potential PTMs of a target protein may increase our understanding of the molecular processes in which it takes part. High-throughput methods for the identification of PTMs are being developed, in particular within the fields of proteomics and mass spectrometry. However, these methods are still in their early stages, and it is indeed advantageous to cut down on the number of experimental steps by integrating computational approaches into the validation procedures. Many advanced methods for the prediction of PTMs exist and many are made publicly available. We describe our experiences with the development of prediction methods for phosphorylation and glycosylation sites and the development of PTM-specific databases. In addition, we discuss novel ideas for PTM visualization (exemplified by kinase landscapes) and improvements for prediction specificity (by using ESS--evolutionary stable sites). As an example, we present a new method for kinase-specific prediction of phosphorylation sites, NetPhosK, which extends our earlier and more general tool, NetPhos. The new server, NetPhosK, is made publicly available at the URL http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetPhosK/. The issues of underestimation, over-prediction and strategies for improving prediction specificity are also discussed.},

Exploring the landscape by molecular dynamics simulations, the microscopic data of the trajectory are encoded into a Conformational Markov Network. The structure of this graph reveals the regions of the conformational space corresponding to the basins of attraction. In addition, handling the Conformational Markov Network, relevant kinetic magnitudes as dwell times and rate constants, or hierarchical relationships among basins, completes the global picture of the landscape. We show the power of the analysis studying a toy model of a funnel-like potential and computing efficiently the conformers of a short peptide, dialanine, paving the way to a systematic study of the Free Energy Landscape in large peptides.},

abstract = {Advances in biological techniques have led to the availability of genome-scale metabolic reconstructions for yeast. The size and complexity of such networks impose limits on what types of analyses one can perform. Constraint-based modelling overcomes some of these restrictions by using physicochemical constraints to describe the potential behaviour of an organism. FBA (flux balance analysis) highlights flux patterns through a network that serves to achieve a particular objective and requires a minimal amount of data to make quantitative inferences about network behaviour. Even though FBA is a powerful tool for system predictions, its general formulation sometimes results in unrealistic flux patterns. A typical example is fermentation in yeast: ethanol is produced during aerobic growth in excess glucose, but this pattern is not present in a typical FBA solution. In the present paper, we examine the issue of yeast fermentation against respiration during growth. We have studied a number of hypotheses from the modelling perspective, and novel formulations of the FBA approach have been tested. By making the observation that more respiration requires the synthesis of more mitochondria, an energy cost related to mitochondrial synthesis is added to the FBA formulation. Results, although still approximate, are closer to experimental observations than earlier FBA analyses, at least on the issue of fermentation.},

Despite their practical value, these databases rely on relative measures of expression and are unable to address the most fundamental question--which genes are expressed in a given cell type. The Gene Expression Barcode is the first database to provide reliable absolute measures of expression for most annotated genes for 131 human and 89 mouse tissue types, including diseased tissue. This is made possible by a novel algorithm that leverages information from the GEO and ArrayExpress public repositories to build statistical models that permit converting data from a single microarray into expressed/unexpressed calls for each gene. For selected platforms, users may upload data and obtain results in a matter of seconds. The raw data, curated annotation, and code used to create our resource are also available at http://rafalab.jhsph.edu/barcode.},

abstract = {Epistasis has substantial impacts on evolution, in particular, the rate of adaptation. We generated combinations of beneficial mutations that arose in a lineage during rapid adaptation of a bacterium whose growth depended on a newly introduced metabolic pathway. The proportional selective benefit for three of the four loci consistently decreased when they were introduced onto more fit backgrounds. These three alleles all reduced morphological defects caused by expression of the foreign pathway. A simple theoretical model segregating the apparent contribution of individual alleles to benefits and costs effectively predicted the interactions between them. These results provide the first evidence that patterns of epistasis may differ for within- and between-gene interactions during adaptation and that diminishing returns epistasis contributes to the consistent observation of decelerating fitness gains during adapta tion.},

abstract = {The extent to which a population diverges from its ancestor through adaptive evolution depends on variation supplied by novel beneficial mutations. Extending earlier work, recent theory makes two predictions that seem to be robust to biological details: the distribution of fitness effects among beneficial mutations before selection should be (i) exponential and (ii) invariant, meaning it is always exponential regardless of the fitness rank of the wild-type allele. Here we test these predictions by assaying the fitness of 665 independently derived single-step mutations in the bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens across a range of environments. We show that the distribution of fitness effects among beneficial mutations is indistinguishable from an exponential despite marked variation in the fitness rank of the wild type across environments. These results suggest that the initial step in adaptive evolution--the production of novel beneficial mutants from which selection sorts--is very general, being characterized by an approximately exponential distribution with many mutations of small effect and few of large effect. We also document substantial variation in the pleiotropic costs of antibiotic resistance, a result that may have implications for strategies aimed at eliminating resistant pathogens in animal and human populations.},

abstract = {Some evolutionary innovations may originate non-adaptively as exaptations, or pre-adaptations, which are by-products of other adaptive traits. Examples include feathers, which originated before they were used in flight, and lens crystallins, which are light-refracting proteins that originated as enzymes. The question of how often adaptive traits have non-adaptive origins has profound implications for evolutionary biology, but is difficult to address systematically. Here we consider this issue in metabolism, one of the most ancient biological systems that is central to all life. We analyse a metabolic trait of great adaptive importance: the ability of a metabolic reaction network to synthesize all biomass from a single source of carbon and energy. We use novel computational methods to sample randomly many metabolic networks that can sustain life on any given carbon source but contain an otherwise random set of known biochemical reactions. We show that when we require such networks to be viable on one particular carbon source, they are typically also viable on multiple other carbon sources that were not targets of selection. For example, viability on glucose may entail viability on up to 44 other sole carbon sources. Any one adaptation in these metabolic systems typically entails multiple potential exaptations. Metabolic systems thus contain a latent potential for evolutionary innovations with non-adaptive origins. Our observations suggest that many more metabolic traits may have non-adaptive origins than is appreciated at present. They also challenge our ability to distinguish adaptive from non-adaptive traits.},

We applied our method to a recent data set that measures GIs for endoplasmic reticulum (ER) genes, using the unfolded protein response as a quantitative phenotype. The results provided reconstructions of known functional pathways including N-linked glycosylation and ER-associated protein degradation. It also contained novel relationships, such as the placement of SGT2 in the tail-anchored biogenesis pathway, a finding that we experimentally validated. Our approach should be readily applicable to the next generation of quantitative GI data sets, as assays become available for additional phenotypes and eventually higher-level organisms.},

abstract = {Multiple, complex molecular events characterize cancer development and progression. Deciphering the molecular networks that distinguish organ-confined disease from metastatic disease may lead to the identification of critical biomarkers for cancer invasion and disease aggressiveness. Although gene and protein expression have been extensively profiled in human tumours, little is known about the global metabolomic alterations that characterize neoplastic progression. Using a combination of high-throughput liquid-and-gas-chromatography-based mass spectrometry, we profiled more than 1,126 metabolites across 262 clinical samples related to prostate cancer (42 tissues and 110 each of urine and plasma). These unbiased metabolomic profiles were able to distinguish benign prostate, clinically localized prostate cancer and metastatic disease. Sarcosine, an N-methyl derivative of the amino acid glycine, was identified as a differential metabolite that was highly increased during prostate cancer progression to metastasis and can be detected non-invasively in urine. Sarcosine levels were also increased in invasive prostate cancer cell lines relative to benign prostate epithelial cells. Knockdown of glycine-N-methyl transferase, the enzyme that generates sarcosine from glycine, attenuated prostate cancer invasion. Addition of exogenous sarcosine or knockdown of the enzyme that leads to sarcosine degradation, sarcosine dehydrogenase, induced an invasive phenotype in benign prostate epithelial cells. Androgen receptor and the ERG gene fusion product coordinately regulate components of the sarcosine pathway. Here, by profiling the metabolomic alterations of prostate cancer progression, we reveal sarcosine as a potentially important metabolic intermediary of cancer cell invasion and aggressivity.},

Its premises are: (1) cancer is derived from a single somatic cell that has accumulated multiple DNA mutations, (2) the default state of cell proliferation in metazoa is quiescence, and (3) cancer is a disease of cell proliferation caused by mutations in genes that control proliferation and the cell cycle. From this compelling simplicity, an increasingly complicated picture has emerged as more than 100 oncogenes and 30 tumor suppressor genes have been identified. To accommodate this complexity, additional ad hoc explanations have been postulated. After a critical review of the data gathered from this perspective, an alternative research program has been proposed. It is based on the tissue organization field theory, the premises of which are that carcinogenesis represents a problem of tissue organization, comparable to organogenesis, and that proliferation is the default state of all cells. The merits of these competing theories are evaluated herein.},

However, all we have at this time is, at best, a fragmentary and only partially correct representation of the interactions between genes, their byproducts, and other cellular entities.

@article{Boubekeur1999,
abstract = {Spheroplasts of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae oxidize pyruvate at a high respiratory rate, whereas isolated mitochondria do not unless malate is added. We show that a cytosolic factor, pyruvate decarboxylase, is required for the non-malate-dependent oxidation of pyruvate by mitochondria. In pyruvate decarboxylase-negative mutants, the oxidation of pyruvate by permeabilized spheroplasts was abolished. In contrast, deletion of the gene (PDA1) encoding the E1alpha subunit of the pyruvate dehydrogenase did not affect the spheroplast respiratory rate on pyruvate but abolished the malate-dependent respiration of isolated mitochondria. Mutants disrupted for the mitochondrial acetaldehyde dehydrogenase gene (ALD7) did not oxidize pyruvate unless malate was added. We therefore propose the existence of a mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase bypass different from the cytosolic one, where pyruvate is decarboxylated to acetaldehyde in the cytosol by pyruvate decarboxylase and then oxidized by mitochondrial acetaldehyde dehydrogenase. This pathway can compensate PDA1 gene deletion for lactate or respiratory glucose growth. However, the codisruption of PDA1 and ALD7 genes prevented the growth on lactate, indicating that each of these pathways contributes to the oxidative metabolism of pyruvate.},

Spontaneous oscillatory dynamics observed in self-synchronized continuous cultures is pervasive, involves much of the cellular network, and provides unique insights into integrative cell physiology. Here, in non-invasive experiments in vivo, we exploit these oscillatory dynamics to analyse the global timing of the cellular network to show the presence of a low-order chaotic component. Although robust to a wide range of environmental perturbations, the system responds and reacts to the imposition of harsh environmental conditions, in this case low pH, by dynamic re-organization of respiration, and this feeds upwards to affect cell division. These complex dynamics can be represented by a tuneable attractor that orchestrates cellular complexity and coherence to the environment.},

abstract = {Succinate dehydrogenases and fumarate reductases are complex mitochondrial or bacterial respiratory chain proteins with remarkably similar structures and functions. Succinate dehydrogenase oxidizes succinate and reduces ubiquinone using a flavin adenine dinucleotide cofactor and iron-sulfur clusters to transport electrons. A model of the quaternary structure of the tetrameric Saccharomyces cerevisiae succinate dehydrogenase was constructed based on the crystal structures of the Escherichia coli succinate dehydrogenase, the E. coli fumarate reductase, and the Wolinella succinogenes fumarate reductase. One FAD and three iron-sulfur clusters were docked into the Sdh1p and Sdh2p catalytic dimer. One b-type heme and two ubiquinone or inhibitor analog molecules were docked into the Sdh3p and Sdh4p membrane dimer. The model is consistent with numerous experimental observations. The calculated free energies of inhibitor binding are in excellent agreement with the experimentally determined inhibitory constants. Functionally important residues identified by mutagenesis of the SDH3 and SDH4 genes are located near the two proposed quinone-binding sites, which are separated by the heme. The proximal quinone-binding site, located nearest the catalytic dimer, has a considerably more polar environment than the distal site. Alternative low energy conformations of the membrane subunits were explored in a molecular dynamics simulation of the dimer embedded in a phospholipid bilayer. The simulation offers insight into why Sdh4p Cys-78 may be serving as the second axial ligand for the heme instead of a histidine residue. We discuss the possible roles of heme and of the two quinone-binding sites in electron transport.},

abstract = {The mean size and percentage of budded cells of a wild-type haploid strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae grown in batch culture over a wide range of doubling times (tau) have been measured using microscopic measurements and a particle size analyzer. Mean size increased over a 2.5-fold range with increasing growth rate (from tau = 450 min to tau = 75 min). Mean size is principally a function of growth rate and not of a particular carbon source. The duration of the budded phase increased at slow growth rates according to the empirical equation, budded phase = 0.5 tau + 27 (all in minutes). Using a recent model of the cell cycle in which division is thought to be asymmetric, equations have been derived for mean cell age and mean cell volume. The data are consistent with the notion that initiation of the cell cycle occurs at "start" after attainment of a critical cell size, and this size is dependent on growth rate, being, at slow growth rates, 63\% of the volume of fast growth rates. Previous reports are reanalyzed in the light of the unequal division model and associated population equations.},

@article{Duesberg1998,
abstract = {Genetic and phenotypic instability are hallmarks of cancer cells, but their cause is not clear. The leading hypothesis suggests that a poorly defined gene mutation generates genetic instability and that some of many subsequent mutations then cause cancer. Here we investigate the hypothesis that genetic instability of cancer cells is caused by aneuploidy, an abnormal balance of chromosomes. Because symmetrical segregation of chromosomes depends on exactly two copies of mitosis genes, aneuploidy involving chromosomes with mitosis genes will destabilize the karyotype. The hypothesis predicts that the degree of genetic instability should be proportional to the degree of aneuploidy. Thus it should be difficult, if not impossible, to maintain the particular karyotype of a highly aneuploid cancer cell on clonal propagation. This prediction was confirmed with clonal cultures of chemically transformed, aneuploid Chinese hamster embryo cells. It was found that the higher the ploidy factor of a clone, the more unstable was its karyotype. The ploidy factor is the quotient of the modal chromosome number divided by the normal number of the species. Transformed Chinese hamster embryo cells with a ploidy factor of 1.7 were estimated to change their karyotype at a rate of about 3\% per generation, compared with 1.8\% for cells with a ploidy factor of 0.95. Because the background noise of karyotyping is relatively high, the cells with low ploidy factor may be more stable than our method suggests. The karyotype instability of human colon cancer cell lines, recently analyzed by Lengnauer et al. [Lengnauer, C., Kinzler, K. W. \& Vogelstein, B. (1997) Nature (London) 386, 623-627], also corresponds exactly to their degree of aneuploidy. We conclude that aneuploidy is sufficient to explain genetic instability and the resulting karyotypic and phenotypic heterogeneity of cancer cells, independent of gene mutation. Because aneuploidy has also been proposed to cause cancer, our hypothesis offers a common, unique mechanism of altering and simultaneously destabilizing normal cellular phenotypes.},

@article{Dingel2009,
abstract = {MOTIVATION: The problem of reverse engineering the dynamics of gene expression profiles is of focal importance in systems biology. Due to noise and the inherent lack of sufficiently large datasets generated via high-throughput measurements, known reconstruction frameworks based on dynamical systems models fail to provide adequate settings for network analysis. This motivates the study of new approaches that produce stochastic lists of explanations for the observed network dynamics that can be efficiently inferred from small sample sets and in the presence of errors. RESULTS: We introduce a novel algebraic modeling framework, termed stochastic polynomial dynamical systems (SPDSs) that can capture the dynamics of regulatory networks based on microarray expression data. Here, we refer to dynamics of the network as the trajectories of gene expression profiles over time. The model assumes that the expression data is quantized in a manner that allows for imposing a finite field structure on the observations, and the existence of polynomial update functions for each gene in the network. The underlying reverse engineering algorithm is based on ideas borrowed from coding theory, and in particular, list-decoding methods for so called Reed-Muller codes. The list-decoding method was tested on synthetic data and on microarray expression measurements from the M(3D) database, corresponding to a subnetwork of the Escherichia coli SOS repair system, as well as on the complete transcription factor network, available at RegulonDB. The results show that SPDSs constructed via list-decoders significantly outperform other algebraic reverse engineering methods, and that they also provide good guidelines for estimating the influence of genes on the dynamics of the network. AVAILABILITY: Software codes for list-decoding algorithms suitable for direct application to quantized expression data will be publicly available at the authors' web-pages.},

In this study, we investigated the reproducibility of growth phenotypes and global gene expression states during adaptive evolution. The results from parallel, replicate adaptive evolution experiments of Escherichia coli K-12 MG1655 grown on either lactate or glycerol minimal media showed that (1) growth phenotypes at the endpoint of evolution are convergent and reproducible; (2) endpoints of evolution have different underlying gene expression states; and (3) the evolutionary gene expression response involves a large number of compensatory expression changes and a smaller number of adaptively beneficial expression changes common across evolution strains. Gene expression changes initially showed a large number of differentially expressed genes in response to an environmental change followed by a return of most genes to a baseline expression level, leaving a relatively small set of differentially expressed genes at the endpoint that varied between evolved populations.},

This trade-off may result in an evolutionary dilemma, because cells with a higher rate but lower yield of ATP production may gain a selective advantage when competing for shared energy resources. Using an analysis of model simulations and biochemical observations, we show that ATP production with a low rate and high yield can be viewed as a form of cooperative resource use and may evolve in spatially structured environments. Furthermore, we argue that the high ATP yield of respiration may have facilitated the evolutionary transition from unicellular to undifferentiated multicellular organisms.},

@article{Sepulveda2010,
abstract = {Metabolic flux analysis (MFA) was performed on mouse embryonic stem cells cultured under three distinct differentiation conditions: classical embryoid body formation (EB), and on surfaces coated with either gelatin (GEL) or matrigel (MAT). MFA was based on 15 metabolic reactions and eight transport steps, and was carried out based on measurements of four substrates and/or metabolites: glucose, lactate, glutamine, and glutamate. Fluxes representing biomass production remained fairly constant for all three culture conditions with at most a 40\% variation. In contrast, major temporal variations, up to 500\%, were observed for all other major central metabolic fluxes across all culture conditions. Fluxes were compared to gene-expression patterns measured by microarray analysis. Particularly interesting is the correlation between the metabolic fluxes with expression patterns of the corresponding genes of the pyruvate to lactate reaction, whereby the genes for several isoforms of the lactate dehydrogenase enzyme were examined. The patterns of this flux were notably different in the EB cultures compared to the GEL and MAT cultures and reflected differences in oxygen and nutrient transport in EB vs. the GEL and MAT cultures. Another novel finding of this study is an event occurring between Days 4 and 5 of differentiation, which was identified by a notable change in both the metabolic fluxes and gene-expression patterns. This suggests that metabolic patterns can be used as effective beacons of changes in differentiating stem cells. Overall, and qualitatively, core metabolic fluxes, under the three culture conditions examined, correlated well with gene-expression patterns.},

@article{Harrison2007,
abstract = {Why are most genes dispensable? The impact of gene deletions may depend on the environment (plasticity), the presence of compensatory mechanisms (mutational robustness), or both. Here, we analyze the interaction between these two forces by exploring the condition-dependence of synthetic genetic interactions that define redundant functions and alternative pathways. We performed systems-level flux balance analysis of the yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) metabolic network to identify genetic interactions and then tested the model's predictions with in vivo gene-deletion studies. We found that the majority of synthetic genetic interactions are restricted to certain environmental conditions, partly because of the lack of compensation under some (but not all) nutrient conditions. Moreover, the phylogenetic cooccurrence of synthetically interacting pairs is not significantly different from random expectation. These findings suggest that these gene pairs have at least partially independent functions, and, hence, compensation is only a byproduct of their evolutionary history. Experimental analyses that used multiple gene deletion strains not only confirmed predictions of the model but also showed that investigation of false predictions may both improve functional annotation within the model and also lead to the discovery of higher-order genetic interactions. Our work supports the view that functional redundancy may be more apparent than real, and it offers a unified framework for the evolution of environmental adaptation and mutational robustness.},

The biological stationary state, the G1 state, is a global attractor of the dynamics. The biological pathway, the cell-cycle sequence of protein states, is a globally attracting trajectory of the dynamics. These properties are largely preserved with respect to small perturbations to the network. These results suggest that cellular regulatory networks are robustly designed for their functions.},

Through computational studies, we show that it is generally difficult to adjust a negative feedback oscillator's frequency without compromising its amplitude, whereas with positive-plus-negative feedback, one can achieve a widely tunable frequency and near-constant amplitude. This tunability makes the latter design suitable for biological rhythms like heartbeats and cell cycles that need to provide a constant output over a range of frequencies. Positive-plus-negative oscillators also appear to be more robust and easier to evolve, rationalizing why they are found in contexts where an adjustable frequency is unimportant.},

@article{Tuller2010,
abstract = {Recent years have seen intensive progress in measuring protein translation. However, the contributions of coding sequences to the efficiency of the process remain unclear. Here, we identify a universally conserved profile of translation efficiency along mRNAs computed based on adaptation between coding sequences and the tRNA pool. In this profile, the first approximately 30-50 codons are, on average, translated with a low efficiency. Additionally, in eukaryotes, the last approximately 50 codons show the highest efficiency over the full coding sequence. The profile accurately predicts position-dependent ribosomal density along yeast genes. These data suggest that translation speed and, as a consequence, ribosomal density are encoded by coding sequences and the tRNA pool. We suggest that the slow "ramp" at the beginning of mRNAs serves as a late stage of translation initiation, forming an optimal and robust means to reduce ribosomal traffic jams, thus minimizing the cost of protein expression.},

@article{Gong2007a,
abstract = {Different cell types could respond to the same set of stimuli in very different ways, so it is important to collect and integrate these experimental data in a cell-type specific manner in order to properly model these processes. In practice, however, cellular or biochemical models were usually constructed separately, with data from multiple cell sources, making it difficult to compare or combine these models. To circumvent this problem, we propose to conduct the model integration at the data level. To facilitate this purpose we have designed a data structure (CellFrame) to store cell-specific data, such as cellular component measurement and stimulus-response, and to infer cell perturbation network (a cellular network representing the stimulus-response relationships between the cellular and/or environmental components). The CellFrame database consists of two data types: data classes and supporting classes. Data classes constitute three modules: cell component measurement, qualitative cell perturbation, and quantitative cell perturbation. Supporting classes serve as adaptors, linking to external molecular or literature databases. We have implemented an initial version of CellFrame, which contains data collected from reported experiments on human brain astrocytoma and colorectal cancer cell lines (http://cellframe.bioknowledge.org). Perturbation networks are inferred following Boolean differential calculus. CellFrame will provide an opportunity to integrate cell biological data from a wide variety of experimental groups to help build cell models and design further experiments.},

abstract = {A large-scale in silico evaluation of gene deletions in Saccharomyces cerevisiae was conducted using a genome-scale reconstructed metabolic model. The effect of 599 single gene deletions on cell viability was simulated in silico and compared to published experimental results. In 526 cases (87.8\%), the in silico results were in agreement with experimental observations when growth on synthetic complete medium was simulated. Viable phenotypes were correctly predicted in 89.4\% (496 out of 555) and lethal phenotypes were correctly predicted in 68.2\% (30 out of 44) of the cases considered. The in silico evaluation was solely based on the topological properties of the metabolic network which is based on well-established reaction stoichiometry. No interaction or regulatory information was accounted for in the in silico model. False predictions were analyzed on a case-by-case basis for four possible inadequacies of the in silico model: (1) incomplete media composition, (2) substitutable biomass components, (3) incomplete biochemical information, and (4) missing regulation. This analysis eliminated a number of false predictions and suggested a number of experimentally testable hypotheses. A genome-scale in silico model can thus be used to systematically reconcile existing data and fill in our knowledge gaps about an organism.},

@article{Kauffman1989,
abstract = {Adaptive evolution is, to a large extent, a complex combinatorial optimization process. Such processes can be characterized as “uphill walks on rugged fitness landscapes”. Concrete examples of fitness landscapes include the distribution of any specific functional property such as the capacity to catalyze a specific reaction, or bind a specific ligand, in “protein space”. In particular, the property might be the affinity of all possible antibody molecules for a specific antigenic determinant. That affinity landscape presumably plays a critical role in maturation of the immune response. In this process, hypermutation and clonal selection act to select antibody V region mutant variants with successively higher affinity for the immunizing antigen. The actual statistical structure of affinity landscapes, although knowable, is currently unknown. Here, we analyze a class of mathematical models we call NK models. We show that these models capture significant features of the maturation of the immune response, which is currently thought to share features with general protein evolution. The NK models have the important property that, as the parameter K increases, the “ruggedness” of the NK landscape varies from a single peaked “Fujiyama” landscape to a multi-peaked “badlands” landscape. Walks to local optima on such landscapes become shorter as K increases. This fact allows us to choose a value of K that corresponds to the experimentally observed number of mutational “steps”, 6–8, taken as an antibody sequence matures. If the mature antibody is taken to correspond to a local optimum in the model, tuning the model requires that K be about 40, implying that the functional contribution of each amino acid in the V region is affected by about 40 others. Given this value of K, the model then predicts several features of “antibody space” that are in qualitative agreement with experiment: (1) The fraction of fitter variants of an initial “roughed in” germ line antibody amplified by clonal selection is about 1–2\%. (2) Mutations at some sites of the mature antibody hardly affect antibody function at all, but mutations at other sites dramatically decrease function. (3) The same “roughed in” antibody sequence can “walk” to many mature antibody sequences. (4) Many adaptive walks can end on the same local optimum. (5) Comparison of different mature sequences derived from the same initial V region shows evolutionary hot spots and parallel mutations. All these predictions are open to detailed testing by obtaining monoclonal antibodies early in the immune response and carrying out in vitro mutagenesis and adaptive hill climbing with respect to affinity for the immunizing antigen.},

abstract = {The effect of calorie restriction (CR) on life span extension, demonstrated in organisms ranging from yeast to mice, may involve the down-regulation of pathways, including Tor, Akt, and Ras. Here, we present data suggesting that yeast Tor1 and Sch9 (a homolog of the mammalian kinases Akt and S6K) is a central component of a network that controls a common set of genes implicated in a metabolic switch from the TCA cycle and respiration to glycolysis and glycerol biosynthesis. During chronological survival, mutants lacking SCH9 depleted extracellular ethanol and reduced stored lipids, but synthesized and released glycerol. Deletion of the glycerol biosynthesis genes GPD1, GPD2, or RHR2, among the most up-regulated in long-lived sch9Delta, tor1Delta, and ras2Delta mutants, was sufficient to reverse chronological life span extension in sch9Delta mutants, suggesting that glycerol production, in addition to the regulation of stress resistance systems, optimizes life span extension. Glycerol, unlike glucose or ethanol, did not adversely affect the life span extension induced by calorie restriction or starvation, suggesting that carbon source substitution may represent an alternative to calorie restriction as a strategy to delay aging.},

However, because high concentration of free intracellular iron is cytotoxic, cells have developed complex regulatory networks that keep free intracellular iron concentration at optimal range, allowing the incorporation of the metal into iron-using enzymes and minimizing damage to the cell. We built a mathematical model of the network that controls iron uptake and usage in the bacterium Escherichia coli to explore the dynamics of iron flow. We simulate the effect of sudden decrease or increase in the extracellular iron level on intracellular iron distribution. Based on the results of simulations we discuss the possible roles of the small RNA RyhB and the Fe-S cluster assembly systems in the optimal redistribution of iron flows. We suggest that Fe-S cluster assembly is crucial to prevent the accumulation of toxic levels of free intracellular iron when the environment suddenly becomes iron rich.},

The pattern of variation within the lineage suggested that it originated in Mongolia approximately 1,000 years ago.

abstract = {Palindromic sequences are important DNA motifs involved in the regulation of different cellular processes, but are also a potential source of genetic instability. In order to initiate a systematic study of palindromes at the whole genome level, we developed a computer program that can identify, locate and count palindromes in a given sequence in a strictly defined way. All palindromes, defined as identical inverted repeats without spacer DNA, can be analyzed and sorted according to their size, frequency, GC content or alphabetically. This program was then used to prepare a catalog of all palindromes present in the chromosomal DNA of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. For each palindrome size, the observed palindrome counts were significantly different from those in the randomly generated equivalents of the yeast genome. However, while the short palindromes (2-12 bp) were under-represented, the palindromes longer than 12 bp were over-represented, AT-rich and preferentially located in the intergenic regions. The 44-bp palindrome found between the genes CDC53 and LYS21 on chromosome IV was the longest palindrome identified and contained only two C-G base pairs. Avoidance of coding regions was also observed for palindromes of 4-12 bp, but was less pronounced. Dinucleotide analysis indicated a strong bias against palindromic dinucleotides that could explain the observed short palindrome avoidance. We discuss some possible mechanisms that may influence the evolutionary dynamics of palindromic sequences in the yeast genome.},

Epistasis, or gene-gene interaction, has also been treated as an exception to the Mendelian one gene-one phenotype paradigm. This simplified perspective belies the pervasive complexity of biology and hinders progress toward a deeper understanding of biological systems. We assert that epistasis and pleiotropy are not isolated occurrences, but ubiquitous and inherent properties of biomolecular networks. These phenomena should not be treated as exceptions, but rather as fundamental components of genetic analyses. A systems level understanding of epistasis and pleiotropy is, therefore, critical to furthering our understanding of human genetics and its contribution to common human disease. Finally, graph theory offers an intuitive and powerful set of tools with which to study the network bases of these important genetic phenomena.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Many biological phenomena involve extensive interactions between many of the biological pathways present in cells. However, extraction of all the inherent biological pathways remains a major challenge in systems biology. With the advent of high-throughput functional genomic techniques, it is now possible to infer biological pathways and pathway organization in a systematic way by integrating disparate biological information. RESULTS: Here, we propose a novel integrated approach that uses network topology to predict biological pathways. We integrated four types of biological evidence (protein-protein interaction, genetic interaction, domain-domain interaction and semantic similarity of Gene Ontology terms) to generate a functionally associated network. This network was then used to develop a new pathway finding algorithm to predict biological pathways in yeast. Our approach discovered 195 biological pathways and 31 functionally redundant pathway pairs in yeast. By comparing our identified pathways to three public pathway databases (KEGG, BioCyc and Reactome), we observed that our approach achieves a maximum positive predictive value of 12.8\% and improves on other predictive approaches. This study allows us to reconstruct biological pathways and delineates cellular machinery in a systematic view.},

@article{VanderRest1995,
abstract = {The composition of phospholipids, sphingolipids, and sterols in the plasma membrane has a strong influence on the activity of the proteins associated or embedded in the lipid bilayer. Since most lipid-synthesizing enzymes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae are located in intracellular organelles, an extensive flux of lipids from these organelles to the plasma membrane is required. Although the pathway of protein traffic to the plasma membrane is similar to that of most of the lipids, the bulk flow of lipids is separate from vesicle-mediated protein transport. Recent advances in the analysis of membrane budding and membrane fusion indicate that the mechanisms of protein transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi and from the Golgi to plasma membrane are similar. The majority of plasma membrane proteins transport solutes across the membrane. A number of ATP-dependent export systems have been detected that couple the hydrolysis of ATP to transport of molecules out of the cell. The hydrolysis of ATP by the plasma membrane H(+)-ATPase generates a proton motive force which is used to drive secondary transport processes. In S. cerevisiae, many substrates are transported by more than one system. Transport of monosaccharide is catalyzed by uniport systems, while transport of disaccharides, amino acids, and nucleosides is mediated by proton symport systems. Transport activity can be regulated at the level of transcription, e.g., induction and (catabolite) repression, but transport proteins can also be affected posttranslationally by a process termed catabolite inactivation. Catabolite inactivation is triggered by the addition of fermentable sugars, intracellular acidification, stress conditions, and/or nitrogen starvation. Phosphorylation and/or ubiquitination of the transport proteins has been proposed as an initial step in the controlled inactivation and degradation of the target enzyme. The use of artificial membranes, like secretory vesicles and plasma membranes fused with proteoliposomes, as model systems for studies on the mechanism and regulation of transport is evaluated.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The detection of true significant cases under multiple testing is becoming a fundamental issue when analyzing high-dimensional biological data. Unfortunately, known multitest adjustments reduce their statistical power as the number of tests increase. We propose a new multitest adjustment, based on a sequential goodness of fit metatest (SGoF), which increases its statistical power with the number of tests. The method is compared with Bonferroni and FDR-based alternatives by simulating a multitest context via two different kinds of tests: 1) one-sample t-test, and 2) homogeneity G-test. RESULTS: It is shown that SGoF behaves especially well with small sample sizes when 1) the alternative hypothesis is weakly to moderately deviated from the null model, 2) there are widespread effects through the family of tests, and 3) the number of tests is large. CONCLUSION: Therefore, SGoF should become an important tool for multitest adjustment when working with high-dimensional biological data.},

@article{Pomerening2008,
abstract = {In Xenopus embryos, the cell cycle is driven by an autonomous biochemical oscillator that controls the periodic activation and inactivation of cyclin B1-CDK1. The oscillator circuit includes a system of three interlinked positive and double-negative feedback loops (CDK1 -> Cdc25 -> CDK1; CDK1 -/ Wee1 -/ CDK1; and CDK1 -/ Myt1 -/ CDK1) that collectively function as a bistable trigger. Previous work established that this bistable trigger is essential for CDK1 oscillations in the early embryonic cell cycle. Here, we assess the importance of the trigger in the somatic cell cycle, where checkpoints and additional regulatory mechanisms could render it dispensable. Our approach was to express the phosphorylation site mutant CDK1AF, which short-circuits the feedback loops, in HeLa cells, and to monitor cell cycle progression by live cell fluorescence microscopy. We found that CDK1AF-expressing cells carry out a relatively normal first mitosis, but then undergo rapid cycles of cyclin B1 accumulation and destruction at intervals of 3-6 h. During these cycles, the cells enter and exit M phase-like states without carrying out cytokinesis or karyokinesis. Phenotypically similar rapid cycles were seen in Wee1 knockdown cells. These findings show that the interplay between CDK1, Wee1/Myt1, and Cdc25 is required for the establishment of G1 phase, for the normal approximately 20-h cell cycle period, and for the switch-like oscillations in cyclin B1 abundance characteristic of the somatic cell cycle. We propose that the HeLa cell cycle is built upon an unreliable negative feedback oscillator and that the normal high reliability, slow pace and switch-like character of the cycle is imposed by a bistable CDK1/Wee1/Myt1/Cdc25 system.},

abstract = {Sometimes mutations in two genes produce a phenotype that is surprising in light of each mutation's individual effects. This phenomenon, which defines genetic interaction, can reveal functional relationships between genes and pathways. For example, double mutants with surprisingly slow growth define synergistic interactions that can identify compensatory pathways or protein complexes. Recent studies have used four mathematically distinct definitions of genetic interaction (here termed Product, Additive, Log, and Min). Whether this choice holds practical consequences has not been clear, because the definitions yield identical results under some conditions. Here, we show that the choice among alternative definitions can have profound consequences. Although 52\% of known synergistic genetic interactions in Saccharomyces cerevisiae were inferred according to the Min definition, we find that both Product and Log definitions (shown here to be practically equivalent) are better than Min for identifying functional relationships. Additionally, we show that the Additive and Log definitions, each commonly used in population genetics, lead to differing conclusions related to the selective advantages of sexual reproduction.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Epistasis has been historically used to describe the phenomenon that the effect of a given gene on a phenotype can be dependent on one or more other genes, and is an essential element for understanding the association between genetic and phenotypic variations. Quantifying epistasis of orders higher than two is very challenging due to both the computational complexity of enumerating all possible combinations in genome-wide data and the lack of efficient and effective methodologies. OBJECTIVES: In this study, we propose a fast, non-parametric, and model-free measure for three-way epistasis. METHODS: Such a measure is based on information gain, and is able to separate all lower order effects from pure three-way epistasis. RESULTS: Our method was verified on synthetic data and applied to real data from a candidate-gene study of tuberculosis in a West African population. In the tuberculosis data, we found a statistically significant pure three-way epistatic interaction effect that was stronger than any lower-order associations. CONCLUSION: Our study provides a methodological basis for detecting and characterizing high-order gene-gene interactions in genetic association studies.},

Analysis of translation in mouse embryonic stem cells reveals thousands of strong pause sites and unannotated translation products. These include amino-terminal extensions and truncations and upstream open reading frames with regulatory potential, initiated at both AUG and non-AUG codons, whose translation changes after differentiation.

We discovered a diverse set of proteins whose depletion selectively impaired the viability of Ras mutant cells. Among these we observed a strong enrichment for genes with mitotic functions. We describe a pathway involving the mitotic kinase PLK1, the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome, and the proteasome that, when inhibited, results in prometaphase accumulation and the subsequent death of Ras mutant cells. Gene expression analysis indicates that reduced expression of genes in this pathway correlates with increased survival of patients bearing tumors with a Ras transcriptional signature. Our results suggest a previously underappreciated role for Ras in mitotic progression and demonstrate a pharmacologically tractable pathway for the potential treatment of cancers harboring Ras mutations.},

abstract = {The discovery of molecular pathways is a challenging problem and its solution relies on the identification of causal molecular interactions in genomics data. Causal molecular interactions can be discovered using randomized experiments; however such experiments are often costly, infeasible, or unethical. Fortunately, algorithms that infer causal interactions from observational data have been in development for decades, predominantly in the quantitative sciences, and many of them have recently been applied to genomics data. While these algorithms can infer unoriented causal interactions between involved molecular variables (i.e., without specifying which one is the cause and which one is the effect), causally orienting all inferred molecular interactions was assumed to be an unsolvable problem until recently. In this work, we use transcription factor-target gene regulatory interactions in three different organisms to evaluate a new family of methods that, given observational data for just two causally related variables, can determine which one is the cause and which one is the effect.},

It is a model system for the tissue types and genetic diversity of human cancers and has been extensively molecularly characterized. Here, we present a quantitative proteome and kinome profile of the NCI-60 panel covering, in total, 10,350 proteins (including 375 protein kinases) and including a core cancer proteome of 5,578 proteins that were consistently quantified across all tissue types. Bioinformatic analysis revealed strong cell line clusters according to tissue type and disclosed hundreds of differentially regulated proteins representing potential biomarkers for numerous tumor properties. Integration with public transcriptome data showed considerable similarity between mRNA and protein expression. Modeling of proteome and drug-response profiles for 108 FDA-approved drugs identified known and potential protein markers for drug sensitivity and resistance. To enable community access to this unique resource, we incorporated it into a public database for comparative and integrative analysis (http://wzw.tum.de/proteomics/nci60).

We present a system for following, in individual living cells, the dynamics of p53 and its negative regulator Mdm2 (refs. 1,4-7): this system uses functional p53-CFP and Mdm2-YFP fusion proteins and time-lapse fluorescence microscopy. We found that p53 was expressed in a series of discrete pulses after DNA damage. Genetically identical cells had different numbers of pulses: zero, one, two or more. The mean height and duration of each pulse were fixed and did not depend on the amount of DNA damage. The mean number of pulses, however, increased with DNA damage. This approach can be used to study other signaling systems and suggests that the p53-Mdm2 feedback loop generates a 'digital' clock that releases well-timed quanta of p53 until damage is repaired or the cell dies.},

abstract = {Flux balance models of metabolism use stoichiometry of metabolic pathways, metabolic demands of growth, and optimality principles to predict metabolic flux distribution and cellular growth under specified environmental conditions. These models have provided a mechanistic interpretation of systemic metabolic physiology, and they are also useful as a quantitative tool for metabolic pathway design. Quantitative predictions of cell growth and metabolic by-product secretion that are experimentally testable can be obtained from these models. In the present report, we used independent measurements to determine the model parameters for the wild-type Escherichia coli strain W3110. We experimentally determined the maximum oxygen utilization rate (15 mmol of O2 per g [dry weight] per h), the maximum aerobic glucose utilization rate (10.5 mmol of Glc per g [dry weight] per h), the maximum anaerobic glucose utilization rate (18.5 mmol of Glc per g [dry weight] per h), the non-growth-associated maintenance requirements (7.6 mmol of ATP per g [dry weight] per h), and the growth-associated maintenance requirements (13 mmol of ATP per g of biomass). The flux balance model specified by these parameters was found to quantitatively predict glucose and oxygen uptake rates as well as acetate secretion rates observed in chemostat experiments. We have formulated a predictive algorithm in order to apply the flux balance model to describe unsteady-state growth and by-product secretion in aerobic batch, fed-batch, and anaerobic batch cultures. In aerobic experiments we observed acetate secretion, accumulation in the culture medium, and reutilization from the culture medium. In fed-batch cultures acetate is cometabolized with glucose during the later part of the culture period.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

We characterize the effects of sampling finite population sizes and natural selection at the genotype level. We demonstrate that selection has occurred at several loci and further that there is no general loss or gain of allele diversity. We also observe that despite the complete convergence to ancestral levels of adaptation, allele frequencies only show partial return.},

abstract = {Domain architectures and catalytic functions of enzymes constitute the centerpieces of a metabolic network. These types of information are formulated as a two-layered network consisting of domains, proteins, and reactions—a domain–protein–reaction (DPR) network. We propose an algorithm to reconstruct the evolutionary history of DPR networks across multiple species and categorize the mechanisms of metabolic systems evolution in terms of network changes. The reconstructed history reveals distinct patterns of evolutionary mechanisms between prokaryotic and eukaryotic networks. Although the evolutionary mechanisms in early ancestors of prokaryotes and eukaryotes are quite similar, more novel and duplicated domain compositions with identical catalytic functions arise along the eukaryotic lineage. In contrast, prokaryotic enzymes become more versatile by catalyzing multiple reactions with similar chemical operations. Moreover, different metabolic pathways are enriched with distinct network evolution mechanisms. For instance, although the pathways of steroid biosynthesis, protein kinases, and glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis all constitute prominent features of animal-specific physiology, their evolution of domain architectures and catalytic functions follows distinct patterns. Steroid biosynthesis is enriched with reaction creations but retains a relatively conserved repertoire of domain compositions and proteins. Protein kinases retain conserved reactions but possess many novel domains and proteins. In contrast, glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis has high rates of reaction/protein creations and domain recruitments. Finally, we elicit and validate two general principles underlying the evolution of DPR networks: 1) duplicated enzyme proteins possess similar catalytic functions and 2) the majority of novel domains arise to catalyze novel reactions. These results shed new lights on the evolution of metabolic systems.},

abstract = {A novel mechanistic model for the growth of baker's yeast on glucoseis presented. It is based on the fact that glucose degradation proceeds via two pathways under conditions of aerobic ethanol formation. Part is metabolized oxidatively and part reductively, with ethanol being the end product of reductive energy metabolism. The corresponding metabolic state is designated oxidoreductive. Ethanol can be used oxidatively only. Maximum rates of oxidative glucose and ethanol degradation are governed by the respiratory capacity of the cells. The model is formulated by using the stoichiometric growth equations for pure oxidative and reductive (fermentative) glucose and ethanol metabolism. Together with the experimentally determinable yield coefficients (Y(X/S)) for the respective metabolic pathways, the resulting equation system is sufficiently determined. The superiority of the presented model over hitherto published ones is based on two essential novelities. (1) The model was developed on experimentally easily accessible parameters only. (2) For the modeling of aerobic ethanol formation, the substrate flow was split into two simultaneously operating (i.e., in parallel) metabolic pathways that exhibit different but constant energy-generating efficiencies (respiration and fermentation) and consequently different and constant biomass yields (Y(X/S)). The model allows the prediction of experimental data without parameter adaption in a biologically dubious manner.},

abstract = {Oscillations in patterns of expression of a large fraction of yeast genes are associated with the "metabolic cycle," usually seen only in prestarved, continuous cultures of yeast. We used FISH of mRNA in individual cells to test the hypothesis that these oscillations happen in single cells drawn from unsynchronized cultures growing exponentially in chemostats. Gene-expression data from synchronized cultures were used to predict coincident appearance of mRNAs from pairs of genes in the unsynchronized cells. Quantitative analysis of the FISH results shows that individual unsynchronized cells growing slowly because of glucose limitation or phosphate limitation show the predicted oscillations. We conclude that the yeast metabolic cycle is an intrinsic property of yeast metabolism and does not depend on either synchronization or external limitation of growth by the carbon source.},

abstract = {Evolutionary adaptations in metabolic networks are fundamental to evolution of microbial growth. Studies on unneeded protein synthesis indicate reductions in fitness upon nonfunctional protein synthesis, showing that cell growth is limited by constraints acting on cellular protein content. Here, we present a theory for optimal metabolic enzyme activity when cells are selected for maximal growth-rate given such growth-limiting biochemical constraints. We show how optimal enzyme levels can be understood to result from an enzyme benefit minus cost optimization. The constraints we consider originate from different biochemical aspects of microbial growth, such as competition for limiting amounts of ribosomes or RNA polymerases, or limitations in available energy. Enzyme benefit is related to its kinetics and its importance for fitness, while enzyme cost expresses to what extent resource consumption reduces fitness through constraint-induced reductions of other enzyme levels. A metabolic fitness landscape is introduced to define the fitness potential of an enzyme. This concept is related to the selection coefficient of the enzyme and can be expressed in terms of its fitness benefit and cost.},

abstract = {When prototrophic yeast cells are cultured under nutrient-limited conditions that mimic growth in the wild, rather than in the high-glucose solutions used in most laboratory studies, they exhibit a robustly periodic metabolic cycle. Over a cycle of 4 to 5 hours, yeast cells rhythmically alternate between glycolysis and respiration. The cell division cycle is tightly constrained to the reductive phase of this yeast metabolic cycle, with DNA replication taking place only during the glycolytic phase. We show that cell cycle mutants impeded in metabolic cycle-directed restriction of cell division exhibit substantial increases in spontaneous mutation rate. In addition, disruption of the gene encoding a DNA checkpoint kinase that couples the cell division cycle to the circadian cycle abolishes synchrony of the metabolic and cell cycles. Thus, circadian, metabolic, and cell division cycles may be coordinated similarly as an evolutionarily conserved means of preserving genome integrity.},

abstract = {Dietary restriction feeding extends survival in a range of species but a detailed understanding of the underlying mechanism is lacking. There is interest therefore in identifying a more targeted approach to replicate this effect on survival. We report that in rats dietary supplementation with alpha-lipoic acid, has markedly differing effects on lifetime survival depending upon the dietary history of the animal. When animals are switched from DR feeding to ad libitum feeding with a diet supplemented with alpha-lipoic acid, the extended survival characteristic of DR feeding is maintained, even though the animals show accelerated growth. Conversely, switching from ad libitum feeding a diet supplemented with alpha-lipoic acid to DR feeding of the non-supplemented diet, blocks the normal effect of DR to extend survival, even after cessation of lipoic acid supplementation. Unlike the dynamic effect of switching between DR and ad libitum feeding with a non-supplemented diet where the subsequent survival trajectory is determined by the new feeding regime, lipoic acid fixes the survival trajectory to that established by the initial feeding regime. Ad libitum feeding a diet supplemented with lipoic acid can therefore act as mimetic of DR to extend survival.},

In principle, evolution to this high- resistance b-lactamase might follow any of the 120 mutational trajectories linking these alleles. However, we demonstrate that 102 trajectories are inaccessible to Darwinian selection and that many of the remaining trajectories have negligible probabilities of realization, because four of these five mutations fail to increase drug resistance in some combinations. Pervasive biophysical pleiotropy within the b-lactamase seems to be responsible, and because such pleiotropy appears to be a general property of missense mutations, we conclude that much protein evolution will be similarly constrained. This implies that the protein tape of life may be largely reproducible and even predictable.},

abstract = {Genome-scale metabolic models of organisms can be reconstructed using annotated genome sequence information, well-curated databases, and primary research literature. The metabolic reaction stoichiometry and other physicochemical factors are incorporated into the model, thus imposing constraints that represent restrictions on phenotypic behavior. Based on this premise, the theoretical capabilities of the metabolic network can be assessed by using a mathematical technique known as flux balance analysis (FBA). This modeling framework, also known as the constraint-based reconstruction and analysis approach, differs from other modeling strategies because it does not attempt to predict exact network behavior. Instead, this approach uses known constraints to separate the states that a system can achieve from those that it cannot. In recent years, this strategy has been employed to probe the metabolic capabilities of a number of organisms, to generate and test experimental hypotheses, and to predict accurately metabolic phenotypes and evolutionary outcomes. This chapter introduces the constraint-based modeling approach and focuses on its application to computationally predicting gene essentiality.},

abstract = {Fumarate hydratase (FH) is an enzyme of the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle) that catalyses the hydration of fumarate into malate. Germline mutations of FH are responsible for hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal-cell cancer (HLRCC). It has previously been demonstrated that the absence of FH leads to the accumulation of fumarate, which activates hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) at normal oxygen tensions. However, so far no mechanism that explains the ability of cells to survive without a functional TCA cycle has been provided. Here we use newly characterized genetically modified kidney mouse cells in which Fh1 has been deleted, and apply a newly developed computer model of the metabolism of these cells to predict and experimentally validate a linear metabolic pathway beginning with glutamine uptake and ending with bilirubin excretion from Fh1-deficient cells. This pathway, which involves the biosynthesis and degradation of haem, enables Fh1-deficient cells to use the accumulated TCA cycle metabolites and permits partial mitochondrial NADH production. We predicted and confirmed that targeting this pathway would render Fh1-deficient cells non-viable, while sparing wild-type Fh1-containing cells. This work goes beyond identifying a metabolic pathway that is induced in Fh1-deficient cells to demonstrate that inhibition of haem oxygenation is synthetically lethal when combined with Fh1 deficiency, providing a new potential target for treating HLRCC patients.},

abstract = {Cancers have clonal, aneuploid karyotypes that evolve ever more malignant phenotypes spontaneously. Because these facts are hard to explain by conventional mutation theory, we propose here a karyotypic cancer theory. According to this theory, carcinogens initiate carcinogenesis by inducing random aneuploidy. Aneuploidy then catalyzes karyotypic evolutions, because it destabilizes the karyotype by unbalancing teams of proteins that segregate, synthesize, and repair chromosomes. Sporadically, such evolutions generate new cancer-causing karyotypes, which are stabilized within narrow limits against the inherent instability of aneuploidy by selection for oncogenic function. Here we have tested this theory prospectively by analyzing the karyotypes of distinct tumorigenic clones, which arose from mass cultures of human cells within a few months after transfection with artificially activated oncogenes. All clones from the same parental cells had individual, "near-clonal" karyotypes and phenotypes, although the parental oncogenes were identical. The karyotypes of distinct tumors formed by a given clone in immunodeficient mice were variants of those of the input clones. The karyotypes of tumorigenic clones also evolved on passages in vitro, in which they acquired either enhanced tumorigenicity spontaneously or resistance against methotrexate upon selection. We conclude that activated oncogenes initiate carcinogenesis indirectly by inducing random aneuploidy, much like conventional carcinogens, but more effectively because the oncogenes are integrated into the genome. Since aneuploidy destabilizes the karyotype, such cells evolve new, cancer-specific karyotypes spontaneously, much like new species. Because individual karyotypes of tumorigenic clones correlate and coevolve with individual phenotypes, we conclude that specific karyotypes as a whole are the genomes of cancer cells. Owing to the flexibility of their aneuploid karyotypes, cancers evolve at rates that are roughly proportional to their degrees of aneuploidy. In sum, genomes consisting of individual and flexible karyotypes explain the characteristic individuality, stability, and flexibility of cancers.},

abstract = {How do deleterious mutations interact to affect fitness? The answer to this question has substantial implications for a variety of important problems in population biology, including the evolution of sex, the rate of adaptation and the conservation of small populations. Here we analyse a mathematical model of competition for food in which deleterious mutations affect competitive ability. We show that, if individuals usually compete in small groups, then competition can easily lead to a type of genetic interaction known as synergistic epistasis. This means that a deleterious mutation is most damaging in a genome that already has many other deleterious mutations. We also show that competition in small groups can produce a large advantage for sexual populations, both in mean fitness and in ability to resist invasion by asexual lineages. One implication of our findings is that experimental efforts to demonstrate synergistic epistasis may not succeed unless the experiments are redesigned to make them much more naturalistic.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: The effort to build a whole-cell model requires the development of new modeling approaches, and in particular, the integration of models for different types of processes, each of which may be best described using different representation. Flux-balance analysis (FBA) has been useful for large-scale analysis of metabolic networks, and methods have been developed to incorporate transcriptional regulation (regulatory FBA, or rFBA). Of current interest is the integration of these approaches with detailed models based on ordinary differential equations (ODEs). RESULTS: We developed an approach to modeling the dynamic behavior of metabolic, regulatory and signaling networks by combining FBA with regulatory Boolean logic, and ordinary differential equations. We use this approach (called integrated FBA, or iFBA) to create an integrated model of Escherichia coli which combines a flux-balance-based, central carbon metabolic and transcriptional regulatory model with an ODE-based, detailed model of carbohydrate uptake control. We compare the predicted Escherichia coli wild-type and single gene perturbation phenotypes for diauxic growth on glucose/lactose and glucose/glucose-6-phosphate with that of the individual models. We find that iFBA encapsulates the dynamics of three internal metabolites and three transporters inadequately predicted by rFBA. Furthermore, we find that iFBA predicts different and more accurate phenotypes than the ODE model for 85 of 334 single gene perturbation simulations, as well for the wild-type simulations. We conclude that iFBA is a significant improvement over the individual rFBA and ODE modeling paradigms.

Typically, FBA is used to study the metabolic flux at a particular steady state of the system. However, there are many situations where the reprogramming of the metabolic network is important. Therefore, the dynamics of these metabolic networks have to be studied. In this paper, we have extended FBA to account for dynamics and present two different formulations for dynamic FBA. These two approaches were used in the analysis of diauxic growth in Escherichia coli. Dynamic FBA was used to simulate the batch growth of E. coli on glucose, and the predictions were found to qualitatively match experimental data. The dynamic FBA formalism was also used to study the sensitivity to the objective function. It was found that an instantaneous objective function resulted in better predictions than a terminal-type objective function. The constraints that govern the growth at different phases in the batch culture were also identified. Therefore, dynamic FBA provides a framework for analyzing the transience of metabolism due to metabolic reprogramming and for obtaining insights for the design of metabolic networks.},

@article{Beerenwinkel2007,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Understanding interactions between mutations and how they affect fitness is a central problem in evolutionary biology that bears on such fundamental issues as the structure of fitness landscapes and the evolution of sex. To date, analyses of fitness landscapes have focused either on the overall directional curvature of the fitness landscape or on the distribution of pairwise interactions. In this paper, we propose and employ a new mathematical approach that allows a more complete description of multi-way interactions and provides new insights into the structure of fitness landscapes. RESULTS: We apply the mathematical theory of gene interactions developed by Beerenwinkel et al. to a fitness landscape for Escherichia coli obtained by Elena and Lenski. The genotypes were constructed by introducing nine mutations into a wild-type strain and constructing a restricted set of 27 double mutants. Despite the absence of mutants higher than second order, our analysis of this genotypic space points to previously unappreciated gene interactions, in addition to the standard pairwise epistasis. Our analysis confirms Elena and Lenski's inference that the fitness landscape is complex, so that an overall measure of curvature obscures a diversity of interaction types. We also demonstrate that some mutations contribute disproportionately to this complexity. In particular, some mutations are systematically better than others at mixing with other mutations. We also find a strong correlation between epistasis and the average fitness loss caused by deleterious mutations. In particular, the epistatic deviations from multiplicative expectations tend toward more positive values in the context of more deleterious mutations, emphasizing that pairwise epistasis is a local property of the fitness landscape. Finally, we determine the geometry of the fitness landscape, which reflects many of these biologically interesting features. CONCLUSION: A full description of complex fitness landscapes requires more information than the average curvature or the distribution of independent pairwise interactions. We have proposed a mathematical approach that, in principle, allows a complete description and, in practice, can suggest new insights into the structure of real fitness landscapes. Our analysis emphasizes the value of non-independent genotypes for these inferences.},

abstract = {The tumor microenvironment has a significant impact on tumor development. Two important determinants in this environment are hypoxia and lactic acidosis. Although lactic acidosis has long been recognized as an important factor in cancer, relatively little is known about how cells respond to lactic acidosis and how that response relates to cancer phenotypes. We develop genome-scale gene expression studies to dissect transcriptional responses of primary human mammary epithelial cells to lactic acidosis and hypoxia in vitro and to explore how they are linked to clinical tumor phenotypes in vivo. The resulting experimental signatures of responses to lactic acidosis and hypoxia are evaluated in a heterogeneous set of breast cancer datasets. A strong lactic acidosis response signature identifies a subgroup of low-risk breast cancer patients having distinct metabolic profiles suggestive of a preference for aerobic respiration. The association of lactic acidosis response with good survival outcomes may relate to the role of lactic acidosis in directing energy generation toward aerobic respiration and utilization of other energy sources via inhibition of glycolysis. This "inhibition of glycolysis" phenotype in tumors is likely caused by the repression of glycolysis gene expression and Akt inhibition. Our study presents a genomic evaluation of the prognostic information of a lactic acidosis response independent of the hypoxic response. Our results identify causal roles of lactic acidosis in metabolic reprogramming, and the direct functional consequence of lactic acidosis pathway activity on cellular responses and tumor development. The study also demonstrates the utility of genomic analysis that maps expression-based findings from in vitro experiments to human samples to assess links to in vivo clinical phenotypes.},

@article{Wang2009,
abstract = {Cellular life is a highly redundant complex system; yet, the evolutionary maintenance of the redundancy remains unexplained. Using a systems biology approach, we infer that 37-47\% of metabolic reactions in Escherichia coli and yeast can be individually removed without blocking the production of any biomass component under any nutritional condition. However, the majority of these redundant reactions are preserved because they have differential maximal efficiencies at different conditions or their loss causes an immediate fitness reduction that can only be regained via mutation, drift, and selection in evolution. The remaining redundancies are attributable to pleiotropic effects or recent horizontal gene transfers. We find that E. coli and yeast exhibit opposite relationships between the functional importance and redundancy level of a reaction, which is inconsistent with the conjecture that redundancies are preserved as an adaptation to back up important parts in the system. Interestingly, the opposite relationships can both be recapitulated by a simple model in which the natural environments of the organisms change frequently. Thus, adaptive backup is neither necessary nor sufficient to explain the high redundancy of cellular metabolic networks. Taken together, our results strongly suggest that redundant reactions are not kept as backups and that the genetic robustness of metabolic networks is an evolutionary by-product.},

abstract = {Cell perturbation data are a very important resource to analyze and reconstruct cell-signaling networks. To facilitate the utilization of this type of data and enable large-scale and automated network reconstruction effort, we have already developed a data structure for storing cell perturbation results and deducing perturbation networks (CellFrame). For automating network analysis, we here propose a computational method called the "alternative pathway approach" (ALPA) in this work. This method can validate the signaling networks with conditional perturbation data extracted from published experiments, and can suggest additional tests to improve the network. It searches the alternative pathway space between all pairs of nodes, constructs pathnets (set of pathways between two nodes) and validates the network edges using conditional perturbation. For pathnets without conditional data, experiments with the fewest number of perturbations or the most parsimonious are designed. For pathnets without experimentally derived or detected pair-wise interactions, ALPA can predict the potential effects or propose additional pathways to expand the existing network. We have tested the ALPA method on the TNFalpha-MAPK signaling cascade; the reconstructed network is consistent with the consensus model. We also used the ALPA algorithm to analyze a yeast gene perturbation network, using the data from the Rosetta compendium of expression profiles, which demonstrates that it can be also used for large-scale analysis. We compared the performance of the ALPA approach with Boolean and Bayesian network algorithms for their efficiency and accuracy, respectively, in network construction.},

This explanation requires negative epistasis, a type of genetic interaction where mutations are more harmful in combination than expected from their separate effects. The conceptual appeal of the mutational deterministic hypothesis has been offset by our inability to identify the mechanistic and evolutionary bases of negative epistasis. Here we show that negative epistasis can evolve as a consequence of sexual reproduction itself. Using an artificial gene network model, we find that recombination between gene networks imposes selection for genetic robustness, and that negative epistasis evolves as a by-product of this selection. Our results suggest that sexual reproduction selects for conditions that favour its own maintenance, a case of evolution forging its own path.},

abstract = {The pervasive influence of resident microorganisms on the phenotype of their hosts is exemplified by the intracellular bacterium Buchnera aphidicola, which provides its aphid partner with essential amino acids (EAAs). We investigated variation in the dietary requirement for EAAs among four pea aphid (Acyrthosiphon pisum) clones. Buchnera-derived nitrogen contributed to the synthesis of all EAAs for which aphid clones required a dietary supply, and to none of the EAAs for which all four clones had no dietary requirement, suggesting that low total dietary nitrogen may select for reduced synthesis of certain EAAs in some aphid clones. The sequenced Buchnera genomes showed that the EAA nutritional phenotype (i.e. the profile of dietary EAAs required by the aphid) cannot be attributed to sequence variation of Buchnera genes coding EAA biosynthetic enzymes. Metabolic modelling by flux balance analysis demonstrated that EAA output from Buchnera can be determined precisely by the flux of host metabolic precursors to Buchnera. Specifically, the four EAA nutritional phenotypes could be reproduced by metabolic models with unique profiles of host inputs, dominated by variation in supply of aspartate, homocysteine and glutamate. This suggests that the nutritional phenotype of the symbiosis is determined principally by host metabolism and transporter genes that regulate nutrient supply to Buchnera. Intraspecific variation in the nutritional phenotype of symbioses is expected to mediate partitioning of plant resources among aphid genotypes, potentially promoting the genetic subdivision of aphid populations. In this way, microbial symbioses may play an important role in the evolutionary diversification of phytophagous insects.},

abstract = {A plausible representation of the relational information among entities in dynamic systems such as a living cell or a social community is a stochastic network that is topologically rewiring and semantically evolving over time. Although there is a rich literature in modeling static or temporally invariant networks, little has been done toward recovering the network structure when the networks are not observable in a dynamic context. In this article, we present a machine learning method called TESLA, which builds on a temporally smoothed l(1)-regularized logistic regression formalism that can be cast as a standard convex-optimization problem and solved efficiently by using generic solvers scalable to large networks. We report promising results on recovering simulated time-varying networks and on reverse engineering the latent sequence of temporally rewiring political and academic social networks from longitudinal data, and the evolving gene networks over >4,000 genes during the life cycle of Drosophila melanogaster from a microarray time course at a resolution limited only by sample frequency.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Inference of evolutionary trees using the maximum likelihood principle is NP-hard. Therefore, all practical methods rely on heuristics. The topological transformations often used in heuristics are Nearest Neighbor Interchange (NNI), Subtree Prune and Regraft (SPR) and Tree Bisection and Reconnection (TBR). However, these topological transformations often fall easily into local optima, since there are not many trees accessible in one step from any given tree. Another more exhaustive topological transformation is p-Edge Contraction and Refinement (p-ECR). However, due to its high computation complexity, p-ECR has rarely been used in practice. RESULTS: To make the p-ECR move more efficient, this paper proposes a new method named p-ECRNJ. The main idea of p-ECRNJ is to use neighbor joining (NJ) to refine the unresolved nodes produced in p-ECR. CONCLUSION: Experiments with real datasets show that p-ECRNJ can find better trees than the best known maximum likelihood methods so far and can efficiently improve local topological transforms in reasonable time.},

Previous investigations have used comprehensive single and double gene knockouts to study gene essentiality and pairwise gene interactions in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Here we conduct an in silico multiple knockout investigation of a flux balance analysis model of the yeast's metabolic network. Cataloging gene sets that provide mutual functional backup, we identify sets of up to eight interacting genes and characterize the 'k robustness' (the depth of backup interactions) of each gene. We find that 74\% (360) of the metabolic genes participate in processes that are essential to growth in a standard laboratory environment, compared with only 13\% previously found to be essential using single knockouts. The genes' k robustness is shown to be a solid indicator of their biological buffering capacity and is correlated with both the genes' environmental specificity and their evolutionary retention.},

@article{Gaeta2009,
abstract = {RATIONALE: Cardiac repolarization alternans is an arrhythmogenic rhythm disturbance, manifested in individual myocytes as a beat-to-beat alternation of action potential durations and intracellular calcium transient magnitudes. Recent experimental studies have reported "subcellular alternans," in which distinct regions of an individual cell are seen to have counterphase calcium alternations, but the mechanism by which this occurs is not well understood. Although previous theoretical work has proposed a possible dynamical mechanism for subcellular alternans formation, no direct evidence for this mechanism has been reported in vitro. Rather, experimental studies have generally invoked fixed subcellular heterogeneities in calcium-cycling characteristics as the mechanism of subcellular alternans formation. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we have generalized the previously proposed dynamical mechanism to predict a simple pacing algorithm by which subcellular alternans can be induced in isolated cardiac myocytes in the presence or absence of fixed subcellular heterogeneity. We aimed to verify this hypothesis using computational modeling and to confirm it experimentally in isolated cardiac myocytes. Furthermore, we hypothesized that this dynamical mechanism may account for previous reports of subcellular alternans seen in statically paced, intact tissue. METHODS AND RESULTS: Using a physiologically realistic computational model of a cardiac myocyte, we show that our predicted pacing algorithm induces subcellular alternans in a manner consistent with theoretical predictions. We then use a combination of real-time electrophysiology and fluorescent calcium imaging to implement this protocol experimentally and show that it robustly induces subcellular alternans in isolated guinea pig ventricular myocytes. Finally, we use computational modeling to demonstrate that subcellular alternans can indeed be dynamically induced during static pacing of 1D fibers of myocytes during tissue-level spatially discordant alternans. CONCLUSION: Here we provide the first direct experimental evidence that subcellular alternans can be dynamically induced in cardiac myocytes. This proposed mechanism may contribute to subcellular alternans formation in the intact heart.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Pseudomonas syringae pv tomato DC3000 (DC3000) is a Gram-negative model plant pathogen that is found in a wide variety of environments. To survive in these diverse conditions it must sense and respond to various environmental cues. One micronutrient required for most forms of life is iron. Bioavailable iron has been shown to be an important global regulator for many bacteria where it not only regulates a wide variety of genes involved in general cell physiology but also virulence determinants. In this study we used microarrays to study differential gene regulation in DC3000 in response to changes in levels of cell-associated iron. RESULTS: DC3000 cultures were grown under highly controlled conditions and analyzed after the addition of iron citrate or sodium citrate to the media. In the cultures supplemented with iron, we found that cell-associated iron increased rapidly while culture densities were not significantly different over 4 hours when compared to cultures with sodium citrate added. Microarray analysis of samples taken from before and after the addition of either sodium citrate or iron citrate identified 386 differentially regulated genes with high statistical confidence. Differentially regulated genes were clustered based on expression patterns observed between comparison of samples taken at different time points and with different supplements. This analysis grouped genes associated with the same regulatory motifs and/or had similar putative or known function. CONCLUSION: This study shows iron is rapidly taken up from the medium by iron-depleted DC3000 cultures and that bioavailable iron is a global cue for the expression of iron transport, storage, and known virulence factors in DC3000. Furthermore approximately 34\% of the differentially regulated genes are associated with one of four regulatory motifs for Fur, PvdS, HrpL, or RpoD.},

@article{Chandrasekaran2010,
abstract = {Prediction of metabolic changes that result from genetic or environmental perturbations has several important applications, including diagnosing metabolic disorders and discovering novel drug targets. A cardinal challenge in obtaining accurate predictions is the integration of transcriptional regulatory networks with the corresponding metabolic network. We propose a method called probabilistic regulation of metabolism (PROM) that achieves this synthesis and enables straightforward, automated, and quantitative integration of high-throughput data into constraint-based modeling, making it an ideal tool for constructing genome-scale regulatory-metabolic network models for less-studied organisms. PROM introduces probabilities to represent gene states and gene-transcription factor interactions. By using PROM, we constructed an integrated regulatory-metabolic network for the model organism, Escherichia coli, and demonstrated that our method based on automated inference is more accurate and comprehensive than the current state of the art, which is based on manual curation of literature. After validating the approach, we used PROM to build a genome-scale integrated metabolic-regulatory model for Mycobacterium tuberculosis, a critically important human pathogen. This study incorporated data from more than 1,300 microarrays, 2,000 transcription factor-target interactions regulating 3,300 metabolic reactions, and 1,905 KO phenotypes for E. coli and M. tuberculosis. PROM identified KO phenotypes with accuracies as high as 95\%, and predicted growth rates quantitatively with correlation of 0.95. Importantly, PROM represents the successful integration of a top-down reconstructed, statistically inferred regulatory network with a bottom-up reconstructed, biochemically detailed metabolic network, bridging two important classes of systems biology models that are rarely combined quantitatively.},

abstract = {Many diseases are caused by failures of metabolic enzymes. These enzymes exist in the context of networks defined by the static topology of enzyme-metabolite interactions and by the reaction fluxes that are feasible at steady state. We use the local topology and the flux correlations to identify how failures in the metabolic network may lead to disease. First, using yeast as a model, we show that flux correlations are a powerful predictor of pairwise mutations that lead to cell death -- more powerful, in fact, than computational models that directly estimate the effects of mutations on cell fitness. These flux correlations, which can exist between enzymes far-separated in the metabolic network, add information to the structural correlations evident from shared metabolites. Second, we show that flux correlations in human align with similarities in Mendelian phenotypes ascribed to known genes. These methods will be useful in predicting genetic interactions in model organisms and understanding the combinatorial effects of genetic variations in humans.},

In particular, we show that an extreme pathway can be recognized by a rank test as simple as the existing rank test for elementary flux modes, without computing all the modes. We make the observation that, unlike elementary flux modes, the property of being an extreme pathway depends on the presence or absence of reactions beyond those involved in the pathway itself. Hence, the property of being an extreme pathway is not a local property. As a consequence, we find that the set of all elementary flux modes for a network includes all the elementary flux modes for all its subnetworks, but that this property does not hold for the set of all extreme pathways.},

abstract = {Natural habitats of some microorganisms may fluctuate erratically, whereas others, which are more predictable, offer the opportunity to prepare in advance for the next environmental change. In analogy to classical Pavlovian conditioning, microorganisms may have evolved to anticipate environmental stimuli by adapting to their temporal order of appearance. Here we present evidence for environmental change anticipation in two model microorganisms, Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We show that anticipation is an adaptive trait, because pre-exposure to the stimulus that typically appears early in the ecology improves the organism's fitness when encountered with a second stimulus. Additionally, we observe loss of the conditioned response in E. coli strains that were repeatedly exposed in a laboratory evolution experiment only to the first stimulus. Focusing on the molecular level reveals that the natural temporal order of stimuli is embedded in the wiring of the regulatory network-early stimuli pre-induce genes that would be needed for later ones, yet later stimuli only induce genes needed to cope with them. Our work indicates that environmental anticipation is an adaptive trait that was repeatedly selected for during evolution and thus may be ubiquitous in biology.},

abstract = {Precise and dynamic measurement of intracellular metabolite levels has been hampered by difficulties in differentiating between adsorbed and imported fractions and the subcellular distribution between cytosol, endomembrane compartments and mitochondria. In the present study, genetically encoded FRET (F\"{o}rster resonance energy transfer)-based sensors were deployed for dynamic measurements of free cytosolic glucose and ATP with varying external supply and in glucose-transport mutants. Moreover, by using the FRET sensors in a microfluidic platform, we were able to monitor in vivo changes of intracellular free glucose in individual yeast cells. We demonstrate the suitability of the FRET sensors for gaining physiological insight by demonstrating that free intracellular glucose and ATP levels are reduced in a hxt5$\Delta$ hexose-transporter mutant compared with wild-type and other hxt$\Delta$ strains.},

abstract = {To an evolutionary geneticist, the most important property of a new mutation is its effect on fitness. Stress is a reduction in fitness that can also alter the selection on new mutations. Although the effects of environmental and genetic stresses are typically studied separately, it is useful to consider them from the same perspective. Here we evaluate the common perception that stress increases selection. We consider various conceptual paradigms for thinking about selection and stress, and then review the empirical data. We reject the notion that stress typically increases selection. Instead, we find that different types of stresses affect selection differently, though the underlying mechanisms are, as yet, unclear in most cases.},

abstract = {We have analyzed the translational status of each mRNA in rapidly growing Saccharomyces cerevisiae. mRNAs were separated by velocity sedimentation on a sucrose gradient, and 14 fractions across the gradient were analyzed by quantitative microarray analysis, providing a profile of ribosome association with mRNAs for thousands of genes. For most genes, the majority of mRNA molecules were associated with ribosomes and presumably engaged in translation. This systematic approach enabled us to recognize genes with unusual behavior. For 43 genes, most mRNA molecules were not associated with ribosomes, suggesting that they may be translationally controlled. For 53 genes, including GCN4, CPA1, and ICY2, three genes for which translational control is known to play a key role in regulation, most mRNA molecules were associated with a single ribosome. The number of ribosomes associated with mRNAs increased with increasing length of the putative protein-coding sequence, consistent with longer transit times for ribosomes translating longer coding sequences. The density at which ribosomes were distributed on each mRNA (i.e., the number of ribosomes per unit ORF length) was well below the maximum packing density for nearly all mRNAs, consistent with initiation as the rate-limiting step in translation. Global analysis revealed an unexpected correlation: Ribosome density decreases with increasing ORF length. Models to account for this surprising observation are discussed.},

abstract = {Cells rapidly alter gene expression in response to environmental stimuli such as nutrients, hormones, and drugs. During the imposed "remodeling" of gene expression, changes in the levels of particular mRNAs do not necessarily correlate with those of the encoded proteins, which could in part rely on the differential recruitment of mRNAs to translating ribosomes. To systematically address this issue, we have established an approach to rapidly access the translational status of each mRNA in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae by affinity purification of endogenously formed ribosomes and the analysis of associated mRNAs with DNA microarrays. Using this method, we compared changes in total mRNA levels (transcriptome) with ribosome associations (translatome) after the application of different conditions of cellular stress. Severe stresses, induced by amino acid depletion or osmotic shock, stimulated highly correlated responses affecting about 15\% of both total RNA levels and translatome. Many of the regulated messages code for functionally related proteins, thus reflecting logical responses to the particular stress. In contrast, mild stress provoked by addition of Calcofluor-white and menadione altered the translatome of approximately 1\% of messages with only marginal effects on total mRNA, suggesting largely uncorrelated responses of transcriptome and translatome. Among these putative translationally regulated messages were most components of the mitochondrial ATPase. Increased polysome associations of corresponding messages and higher mitochondrial ATPase activities upon treatment confirmed the relevance for regulation of this macromolecular complex. Our results suggest the presence of highly sensitive translational regulatory networks that coordinate functionally related messages. These networks are preferentially activated for rapid adaptation of cells to minor environmental perturbations.},

abstract = {Since the advent of gene expression microarray technology more than 10 years ago, many computational approaches have been developed aimed at using statistical associations between mRNA abundance profiles to predict transcriptional regulatory interactions. The ultimate goal is to develop causal network models describing the transcriptional influences that genes exert on each other (via their protein products), which can be used to predict network disruptions (e.g., mutations) leading to a disease phenotype, as well as the appropriate therapeutic intervention. However, microarray data measure only a small component of the interacting variables in a genetic regulatory network, as cells are known to regulate gene expression via many diverse mechanisms. Although many researchers have acknowledged the questionable interpretation of statistical dependencies between mRNA profiles, very little work has been done on theoretically characterizing the nature of inferred dependencies using models that account for unobserved interacting variables. In this work, we review the theory behind reverse engineering algorithms derived from three separate disciplines-system control theory, graphical models, and information theory-and highlight several mathematical relationships between the various methods. We then apply recent theoretical work on constructing graphical models with latent variables to the context of reverse engineering genetic networks. We demonstrate that even the addition of simple latent variables induces statistical dependencies between non-directly interacting (e.g., co-regulated) genes that cannot be eliminated by conditioning on any observed variables.},

abstract = {This paper addresses some questions related to the evolution of cooperative behaviors, in the context of energetic metabolism. Glycolysis can perform either under a dissipative working regime suitable for rapid proliferation or under an efficient regime that entails a good modus operandi under conditions of glucose shortage. A cellular mechanism allowing switching between these two regimes may represent an evolutionary achievement. Thus, we have explored the conditions that might have favored the emergence of such an accommodative mechanism. Because of an inevitable conflict for resources between individual interests and the common good, rapid and inefficient use of glucose is always favored by natural selection in spatially homogeneous environment, regardless of the external conditions. In contrast, when the space is structured, the behavior of the system is determined by its free energy content. If the fuel is abundant, the dissipative strategy dominates the space. However, under famine conditions the efficient regime represents an evolutionary stable strategy in a Harmony game. Between these two extreme situations, both metabolic regimes are engaged in a Prisoner's Dilemma game, where the output depends on the extracellular free energy. The energy transition values that lead from one domain to another have been calculated. We conclude that an accommodative mechanism permitting alternation between dissipative and efficient regimes might have evolved in heterogeneous and highly fluctuating environments. Overall, the current work shows how evolutionary optimization and game-theoretical approaches can be complementary in providing useful insights into biochemical systems.},

We propose a mathematical framework for investigating such questions. We then demonstrate that without assuming any prior biological knowledge, in general no theoretical distinction between the performance of different algorithms can be made. We also give an example of how expected algorithm performance can in principle be altered by utilizing certain features of the data collection protocol.

abstract = {Glycolysis, an ancient energy-processing pathway, can operate either under an efficient but slow regime or, alternatively, under a dissipative but fast-working regime. Trading an increase in efficiency for a decrease in rate represents a cooperative behavior, while a dissipative metabolism can be regarded as a cheating strategy. Herein, using irreversible thermodynamic principles and methods derived from game theory, we investigate whether, and under what conditions, the interplay between these two metabolic strategies may have promoted the clustering of undifferentiated cells. In the current model, multicellularity implies the loss of motility, which represents a hindrance rather than a improvement when competing with mobile single-celled organisms. Despite that, when considering glycolysis as the only energy-processing pathway, we conclude that cells endowed with a low basal anabolic metabolism may have benefited from clustering when faced to compete with cells exhibiting a high anabolic activity.

abstract = {After whole-genome duplication (WGD), deletions return most loci to single copy. However, duplicate loci may survive through selection for increased dosage. Here, we show how the WGD increased copy number of some glycolytic genes could have conferred an almost immediate selective advantage to an ancestor of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, providing a rationale for the success of the WGD. We propose that the loss of other redundant genes throughout the genome resulted in incremental dosage increases for the surviving duplicated glycolytic genes. This increase gave post-WGD yeasts a growth advantage through rapid glucose fermentation; one of this lineage's many adaptations to glucose-rich environments. Our hypothesis is supported by data from enzyme kinetics and comparative genomics. Because changes in gene dosage follow directly from post-WGD deletions, dosage selection can confer an almost instantaneous benefit after WGD, unlike neofunctionalization or subfunctionalization, which require specific mutations. We also show theoretically that increased fermentative capacity is of greatest advantage when glucose resources are both large and dense, an observation potentially related to the appearance of angiosperms around the time of WGD.},

@article{Wittmann2005,
abstract = {In the present work LC-MS/MS was applied to measure the concentrations of intermediates of glycolysis and TCA cycle during autonomous, cell-cycle synchronized oscillations in aerobic, glucose-limited chemostat cultures of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This study complements previously reported oscillations in carbon dioxide production rate, intracellular concentrations of trehalose and various free amino acids, and extracellular acetate and pyruvate in the same culture. Of the glycolytic intermediates, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, 2- and 3-phosphoglycerate, and phosphoenolpyruvate show the most pronounced oscillatory behavior, the latter three compounds oscillating out of phase with the former. This agrees with previously observed metabolic control by phosphofructokinase and pyruvate kinase. Although individually not clearly oscillating, several intermediates of the TCA cycle, i.e., alpha-ketoglutarate, succinate, fumarate, and malate, exhibited increasing concentration during the cell cycle phase with high carbon flux through glycolysis and TCA cycle. The average mass action ratios of beta-phosphoglucomutase and fumarase agreed well with previously determined in vitro equilibrium constants. Minor differences resulted for phosphoglucose isomerase and enolase. Together with the observed close correlation of the pool sizes of the involved metabolites, this might indicate that, in vivo, these reactions are operating close to equilibrium, whereby care must be taken due to possible differences between in vivo and in vitro conditions. Combining the data with previously determined intracellular amino acid levels from the same culture, a few clear correlations between catabolism and anabolism could be identified: phosphoglycerate/serine and alpha-ketoglutarate/lysine exhibited correlated oscillatory behavior, albeit with different phase shifts. Oscillations in intracellular amino acids might therefore be, at least partly, following oscillations of their anabolic precursors.},

@article{Burgess2007,
abstract = {When dietary carbohydrate is unavailable, glucose required to support metabolism in vital tissues is generated via gluconeogenesis in the liver. Expression of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), commonly considered the control point for liver gluconeogenesis, is normally regulated by circulating hormones to match systemic glucose demand. However, this regulation fails in diabetes. Because other molecular and metabolic factors can also influence gluconeogenesis, the explicit role of PEPCK protein content in the control of gluconeogenesis was unclear. In this study, metabolic control of liver gluconeogenesis was quantified in groups of mice with varying PEPCK protein content. Surprisingly, livers with a 90\% reduction in PEPCK content showed only a approximately 40\% reduction in gluconeogenic flux, indicating a lower than expected capacity for PEPCK protein content to control gluconeogenesis. However, PEPCK flux correlated tightly with TCA cycle activity, suggesting that under some conditions in mice, PEPCK expression must coordinate with hepatic energy metabolism to control gluconeogenesis.},

abstract = {As genome-scale metabolic reconstructions emerge, tools to manage their size and complexity will be increasingly important. Flux balance analysis (FBA) is a constraint-based approach widely used to study the metabolic capabilities of cellular or subcellular systems. FBA problems are highly underdetermined and many different phenotypes can satisfy any set of constraints through which the metabolic system is represented. Two of the main concerns in FBA are exploring the space of solutions for a given metabolic network and finding a specific phenotype which is representative for a given task such as maximal growth rate. Here, we introduce a recursive algorithm suitable for overcoming both of these concerns. The method proposed is able to find the alternate optimal patterns of active reactions of an FBA problem and identify the minimal subnetwork able to perform a specific task as optimally as the whole. Our method represents an alternative to and an extension of other approaches conceived for exploring the space of solutions of an FBA problem. It may also be particularly helpful in defining a scaffold of reactions upon which to build up a dynamic model, when the important pathways of the system have not yet been well-defined.},

abstract = {Prototrophic strains of budding yeast exhibit robust metabolic cycles during continuous growth under nutrient-limiting conditions. Previous studies revealed periodic fluctuations of aminolevulinic acid, a precursor of heme, indicating that heme biosynthesis is temporally regulated during these metabolic cycles. The enzyme that catabolizes heme, heme oxygenase, was found to be expressed in a highly periodic manner at both the mRNA and protein level. Heme oxygenase generates the biological gas, carbon monoxide (CO), as a product of heme catabolism. It is shown that pulsed administration of CO induces a phase advancement into the oxidative, respiratory phase of the metabolic cycles. This CO-mediated phase advancement takes place only if the gas is administered during the temporal window when it is predicted to be generated. It is further shown that a yeast strain bearing a targeted deletion of the gene encoding heme oxygenase displays protracted metabolic cycles. These observations provide evidence that gaseous CO may function as a cellular signaling molecule that helps cue metabolic cycling.},

@article{Chait2007,
abstract = {Multidrug combinations are increasingly important in combating the spread of antibiotic-resistance in bacterial pathogens. On a broader scale, such combinations are also important in understanding microbial ecology and evolution. Although the effects of multidrug combinations on bacterial growth have been studied extensively, relatively little is known about their impact on the differential selection between sensitive and resistant bacterial populations. Normally, the presence of a drug confers an advantage on its resistant mutants in competition with the sensitive wild-type population. Here we show, by using a direct competition assay between doxycycline-resistant and doxycycline-sensitive Escherichia coli, that this differential selection can be inverted in a hyper-antagonistic class of drug combinations. Used in such a combination, a drug can render the combined treatment selective against the drug's own resistance allele. Further, this inversion of selection seems largely insensitive to the underlying resistance mechanism and occurs, at sublethal concentrations, while maintaining inhibition of the wild type. These seemingly paradoxical results can be rationalized in terms of a simple geometric argument. Our findings demonstrate a previously unappreciated feature of the fitness landscape for the evolution of resistance and point to a trade-off between the effect of drug interactions on absolute potency and the relative competitive selection that they impose on emerging resistant populations.},

@article{Casazza1984,
abstract = {Intraperitoneal injection of 5 mumol of acetone/g, body weight, into 3 rats previously fed 1\% acetone (v/v) in their drinking water resulted in the appearance in blood serum of 16 +/- 2 nmol of 1,2-propanediol/ml and 8 +/- 1 nmol of 2,3-butanediol/ml. No detectable 1,2-propanediol or 2,3-butanediol was found in the serum of animals after acetone or saline injection without prior addition of acetone to drinking water or in the serum of animals injected with saline after having been maintained on drinking water containing 1\% acetone. These data suggest that acetone both acts to induce a critical enzyme or enzymes and serves as a precursor for the production of 1,2-propanediol. It is also clear from these data that chronic acetone feeding plays a role in 2,3-butanediol production in the rat. Microsomes isolated from the liver of animals maintained on drinking water supplemented with 1\% acetone contained two previously unreported enzymatic activities, acetone monooxygenase which converts acetone to acetol and acetol monooxygenase which converts acetol to methylglyoxal. Both activities require O2 and NADPH. Prior treatment with acetone increased serum D-lactate from 9 nmol/ml +/- 9 nmol/ml in control animals to 77 +/- 36 nmol/ml in acetone-fed animals after injection with 5 mumol of acetone/g, body weight. This is consistent with methylglyoxal being a by-product of acetone metabolism. Two pathways for the conversion of acetone to glucose are proposed, the methylglyoxal and the propanediol pathways. The methylglyoxal pathway is responsible for the conversion of acetone to acetol, acetol to methylglyoxal, and the subsequent conversion of methylglyoxal to glucose. The propanediol pathway involves the conversion of acetol to L-1,2-propanediol by an as yet unknown process. L-1,2-Propanediol is converted to L-lactaldehyde by alcohol dehydrogenase, and L-lactaldehyde is converted to L-lactic acid by aldehyde dehydrogenase. Expression of these metabolic pathways in rat appears to be dependent on the induction of acetone monooxygenase and acetol monooxygenase by acetone.},

abstract = {Fluorescent proteins have revolutionized cell biology by allowing researchers to non-invasively peer into the inner workings of cells and organisms. While the most common applications of fluorescent proteins are to image expression, localization, and dynamics of protein chimeras, there is a growing interest in using fluorescent proteins to create biosensors for minimally invasive imaging of concentrations of ions and small molecules, the activity of enzymes, and changes in the conformation of proteins in living cells. This tutorial review provides an overview of the progress made in the development of fluorescent protein-based biosensors to date.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: A gene regulatory module (GRM) is a set of genes that is regulated by the same set of transcription factors (TFs). By organizing the genome into GRMs, a living cell can coordinate the activities of many genes in response to various internal and external stimuli. Therefore, identifying GRMs is helpful for understanding gene regulation. RESULTS: Integrating transcription factor binding site (TFBS), mutant, ChIP-chip, and heat shock time series gene expression data, we develop a method, called Heat-Inducible Module Identification Algorithm (HIMIA), for reconstructing GRMs of yeast heat shock response. Unlike previous module inference tools which are static statistics-based methods, HIMIA is a dynamic system model-based method that utilizes the dynamic nature of time series gene expression data. HIMIA identifies 29 GRMs, which in total contain 182 heat-inducible genes regulated by 12 heat-responsive TFs. Using various types of published data, we validate the biological relevance of the identified GRMs. Our analysis suggests that different combinations of a fairly small number of heat-responsive TFs regulate a large number of genes involved in heat shock response and that there may exist crosstalk between heat shock response and other cellular processes. Using HIMIA, we identify 68 uncharacterized genes that may be involved in heat shock response and we also identify their plausible heat-responsive regulators. Furthermore, HIMIA is capable of assigning the regulatory roles of the TFs that regulate GRMs and Cst6, Hsf1, Msn2, Msn4, and Yap1 are found to be activators of several GRMs. In addition, HIMIA refines two clusters of genes involved in heat shock response and provides a better understanding of how the complex expression program of heat shock response is regulated. Finally, we show that HIMIA outperforms four current module inference tools (GRAM, MOFA, ReMoDisvovery, and SAMBA), and we conduct two randomization tests to show that the output of HIMIA is statistically meaningful. CONCLUSION: HIMIA is effective for reconstructing GRMs of yeast heat shock response. Indeed, many of the reconstructed GRMs are in agreement with previous studies. Further, HIMIA predicts several interesting new modules and novel TF combinations. Our study shows that integrating multiple types of data is a powerful approach to studying complex biological systems.},

abstract = {DNA replication errors that escape polymerase proofreading and mismatch repair (MMR) can lead to base substitution and frameshift mutations. Such mutations can disrupt gene function, reduce fitness, and promote diseases such as cancer, and are also the raw material of molecular evolution. To analyze with limited bias genomic features associated with DNA polymerase errors, we performed a genome-wide analysis of mutations that accumulate in MMR-deficient diploid lines of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. These lines were derived from a common ancestor and were grown for 160 generations, with bottlenecks reducing the population to one cell every twenty generations. We sequenced to between eight and twenty-fold coverage one wild-type and three mutator lines using Illumina Solexa 36-bp reads. Using an experimentally aware Bayesian genotype caller developed to pool experimental data across sequencing runs for all strains, we detected 28 heterozygous single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 48 single nt insertion/deletions (indels) from the data set. This method was evaluated on simulated data sets and found to have a very low false positive rate (\~{}6 x 10(-5)) and a false negative rate of 0.08 within the unique mapping regions of the genome that contained at least seven-fold coverage. The heterozygous mutations identified by the Bayesian genotype caller were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. All of the mutations were unique to a given line, except for a single nt deletion mutation which occurred independently in two lines. All 48 indels, comprised of 46 deletions and two insertions, occurred in homopolymer tracts (i.e., 47 poly A or T tracts, 1 poly G or C tract) between five and thirteen base pairs long. Our findings are of interest because HP tracts are present at high levels in the yeast genome (> 77,400 for five to twenty nt HP tracts), and frameshift mutations in these regions are likely to disrupt gene function. In addition, they demonstrate that the mutation pattern seen previously in mismatch repair defective strains using a limited number of reporters holds true for the entire genome.},

abstract = {This work concerns the cause of glycolytic oscillations in yeast. We analyse experimental data as well as models in two distinct cases: the relaxation-like oscillations seen in yeast extracts, and the sinusoidal Hopf oscillations seen in intact yeast cells. In the case of yeast extracts, we use flux-change plots and model analyses to establish that the oscillations are driven by on/off switching of phosphofructokinase. In the case of intact yeast cells, we find that the instability leading to the appearance of oscillations is caused by the stoichiometry of the ATP-ADP-AMP system and the allosteric regulation of phosphofructokinase, whereas frequency control is distributed over the reaction network. Notably, the NAD+/NADH ratio modulates the frequency of the oscillations without affecting the instability. This is important for understanding the mutual synchronization of oscillations in the individual yeast cells, as synchronization is believed to occur via acetaldehyde, which in turn affects the frequency of oscillations by changing this ratio.},

In particular, we focus on data generated by continuous time processes (e.g., genetic expression) and sampled at discrete times. To facilitate analysis and interpretation, we employ a "minimal model" to generate arbitrary abundances of stochastic data from networks of known topologies, which are then sub-sampled and in some cases interpolated. We find that DBNs perform relatively poorly when given data sets comparable to those used for genetic network inference. Interpolation does not appear to improve inference success. Finally, we contrast the performance of DBNs with results from linear regression on our synthetic data.},

abstract = {Metabolic control analysis (MCA) of pyruvate dehydrogenase multienzyme (PDH) complex of eucaryotic cells has been carried out using both in vitro and in vivo mechanistic models. Flux control coefficients (FCC) for the sensitivity of pyruvate decarboxylation rate to activities of various PDH complex reactions are determined. FCCs are shown to be strong functions of both pyruvate levels and various components of PDH complex. With the in vitro model, FCCs are shown to be sensitive to only the E1 component of the PDH complex at low pyruvate concentrations. At high pyruvate concentrations, the control is shared by all of the components, with E1 having a negative influence while the other three components, E2, X, and K, exert a positive control over the pyruvate decarboxylation rate. An unusual behavior of deactivation of the E1 component leading to higher net PDH activity is shown to be linked to the combined effect of protein X acylation and E1 deactivation. The steady-state analysis of the in vivo model reveals multiple steady state behavior of pyruvate metabolism with two stable and one unstable steady-states branches. FCCs also display multiplicity, showing completely different control distribution exerted by pyruvate and PDH components on three branches. At low pyruvate concentrations, pyruvate supply dominates the decarboxylation rate and PDH components do not exert any significant control. Reverse control distribution is observed at high pyruvate concentration. The effect of dilution due to cell growth on pyruvate metabolism is investigated in detail. While pyruvate dilution effects are shown to be negligible under all conditions, significant PDH complex dilution effects are observed under certain conditions. Comparison of in vitro and in vivo models shows that PDH components exert different degrees of control outside and inside the cells. At high pyruvate levels, PDH components are shown to exert a higher degree of control when reactions are taking place inside the cells as compared to the in vitro situation.},

abstract = {Metabolic control theory is used to derive conditions under which two deleterious mutations affecting the dynamics of a metabolic pathway act synergistically. It is found that two mutations tend to act mostly synergistically when they reduce the activity of the same enzyme. If the two mutations affect different enzymes, the conclusion depends on the way that fitness is determined by aspects of the pathway. The cases analyzed are: selection for (1) maximal flux, (2) maximal equilibrium concentration (pool size) of an intermediate, (3) optimal flux, (4) optimal pool size. The respective types of epistasis found are: (1) antagonistic, (2) partly synergistic, (3-4) synergism is likely to predominate over antagonism. This results in somewhat different predictions concerning the effect of metabolic mutations on fitness in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. The fact that bacteria are largely clonal but have often a mosaic gene structure is consistent with expectations from the model.},

Mice with a targeted deletion of KLF15, a member of the Kr\"{u}ppel-like family of transcription factors, display severe hypoglycemia after an overnight (18 hr) fast. We provide evidence that defective amino acid catabolism promotes the development of fasting hypoglycemia in KLF15-/- mice by limiting gluconeogenic substrate availability. KLF15-/- liver and skeletal muscle show markedly reduced mRNA expression of amino acid-degrading enzymes. Furthermore, the enzymatic activity of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), which converts the critical gluconeogenic amino acid alanine into pyruvate, is decreased (approximately 50\%) in KLF15-/- hepatocytes. Consistent with this observation, intraperitoneal injection of pyruvate, but not alanine, rescues fasting hypoglycemia in KLF15-/- mice. We conclude that KLF15 plays an important role in the regulation of gluconeogenesis.},

The rarity of reprogramming events appears to contradict the robustness with which the unfathomably complex phenotype of stem cells can reliably be generated. This apparent paradox, however, is naturally explained by the rugged "epigenetic landscape" with valleys representing "preprogrammed" attractor states that emerge from the dynamical constraints of the gene regulatory network. This article provides a pedagogical primer to the fundamental principles of gene regulatory networks as integrated dynamic systems and reviews recent insights in gene expression noise and fate determination, thereby offering a formal framework that may help us to understand why cell fate reprogramming events are inherently rare and yet so robust.},

abstract = {Most heritable traits, including many human diseases, are caused by multiple loci. Studies in both humans and model organisms, such as yeast, have failed to detect a large fraction of the loci that underlie such complex traits. A lack of statistical power to identify multiple loci with small effects is undoubtedly one of the primary reasons for this problem. We have developed a method in yeast that allows the use of much larger sample sizes than previously possible and hence permits the detection of multiple loci with small effects. The method involves generating very large numbers of progeny from a cross between two Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains and then phenotyping and genotyping pools of these offspring. We applied the method to 17 chemical resistance traits and mitochondrial function, and identified loci for each of these phenotypes. We show that the level of genetic complexity underlying these quantitative traits is highly variable, with some traits influenced by one major locus and others by at least 20 loci. Our results provide an empirical demonstration of the genetic complexity of a number of traits and show that it is possible to identify many of the underlying factors using straightforward techniques. Our method should have broad applications in yeast and can be extended to other organisms.},

abstract = {Proteins of the interleukin-1 (IL-1) system include the secreted agonist IL-1beta, and the receptor antagonist IL-1ra, both competing for binding to the IL-1 receptor (IL-1R). IL-1beta and IL-1ra are highly inducible under different forms of stress, such as excitatory neurotransmitter excess occurring during seizures, in infection and inflammation, and during neurotrauma. In each of these conditions induction of IL-1beta precedes that of IL-1ra, resulting in up to 10-20-fold elevation of IL-1beta concentrations. Consequently, IL-1beta induces the elevation of other proinflammatory molecules, including IL-6, IL-1R1, COX2, and iNOS, as well as of IL-1ra. Elevation of IL-1ra is of key importance for quenching the inflammatory response at the IL-1R1 as part of an autoregulatory loop. In seizures, IL-1ra is a strong anticonvulsant and in IL-1beta-dependent fever, a powerful antipyretic. In traumatic brain injury (TBI), the ability of patients to mount an IL-1ra response, as measured in the CSF, strongly correlated with the neurological outcome. Selective induction or pharmacological application of IL-1ra may be sparing neurons in seizures and neurotrauma.},

abstract = {A major challenge in systems biology is to evaluate the feasibility of a biological research project prior to its realization. Since experiments are animals-, cost- and time-consuming, approaches allowing researchers to discriminate alternative hypotheses with a minimal set of experiments are highly desirable. Given a null hypothesis and alternative model, as well as laboratory constraints like observable players, sample size, noise level, and stimulation options, we suggest a method to obtain a list of required experiments in order to significantly reject the null hypothesis model M0 if a specified alternative model MA is realized. For this purpose, we estimate the power to detect a violation of M0 by means of Monte Carlo simulations. Iteratively, the power is maximized over all feasible stimulations of the system using multi-experiment fitting, leading to an optimal combination of experimental settings to discriminate the null hypothesis and alternative model. We prove the importance of simultaneous modeling of combined experiments with quantitative, highly sampled in vivo measurements from the Jak/STAT5 signaling pathway in fibroblasts, stimulated with erythropoietin (Epo). Afterwards we apply the presented iterative experimental design approach to the Jak/STAT3 pathway of primary hepatocytes stimulated with IL-6. Our approach offers the possibility of deciding which scientific questions can be answered based on existing laboratory constraints. To be able to concentrate on feasible questions on account of inexpensive computational simulations yields not only enormous cost and time saving, but also helps to specify realizable, systematic research projects in advance.},

@article{Gachotte1997,
abstract = {Genetic disruption of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae C-4 sterol methyl oxidase ERG25 gene leads to sterol auxotrophy. We have characterized a suppression system that requires two mutations to restore viability to this disrupted strain. One suppressor mutation is erg11, which is blocked in 14alpha-demethylation of lanosterol and is itself an auxotroph. The second suppressor mutation required is either slu1 or slu2 (suppressor of lanosterol utilization). These mutations are leaky versions of HEM2 and HEM4, respectively; addition of exogenous hemin reverses the suppressing effects of slu1 and slu2. Suppression of erg25 by erg11 slu1 (or erg11 slu2) results in a slow-growing strain in which lanosterol, the first sterol in the pathway, accumulates. This result indicates that endogenously synthesized lanosterol can substitute for ergosterol and support growth. In the triple mutants, all but 1 (ERG6) of the 13 subsequent reactions of the ergosterol pathway are inactive. Azole antibiotics (clotrimazole, ketoconazole, and itraconazole) widely used to combat fungal infections are known to do so by inhibiting the ERG11 gene product, the 14alpha-demethylase. In this investigation, we demonstrate that treatment of the sterol auxotrophs erg25 slu1 or erg25 slu2 with azole antibiotics paradoxically restores viability to these strains in the absence of sterol supplementation via the suppression system we have described.},

Network-embedded thermodynamic analysis (NET analysis) is presented as a framework for mechanistic and model-based analysis of these data. By coupling the data to an operating metabolic network via the second law of thermodynamics and the metabolites' Gibbs energies of formation, NET analysis allows inferring functional principles from quantitative metabolite data; for example it identifies reactions that are subject to active allosteric or genetic regulation as exemplified with quantitative metabolite data from Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Moreover, the optimization framework of NET analysis was demonstrated to be a valuable tool to systematically investigate data sets for consistency, for the extension of sub-omic metabolome data sets and for resolving intracompartmental concentrations from cell-averaged metabolome data. Without requiring any kind of kinetic modeling, NET analysis represents a perfectly scalable and unbiased approach to uncover insights from quantitative metabolome data.},

We hybridized genomic DNA from each strain to whole-genome tiling microarrays and detected 1.89 million single nucleotide polymorphisms, which were grouped into 101,343 distinct segregating sites. We also identified 3,985 deletion events of length >200 base pairs among the surveyed strains. We analysed the genome-wide patterns of nucleotide polymorphism and deletion variants, and measured the extent of linkage disequilibrium in S. cerevisiae. These results and the polymorphism resource we have generated lay the foundation for genome-wide association studies in yeast.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Prior to cluster analysis or genetic network analysis it is customary to filter, or remove genes considered to be irrelevant from the set of genes to be analyzed. Often genes whose variation across samples is less than an arbitrary threshold value are deleted. This can improve interpretability and reduce bias. RESULTS: This paper introduces modular models for representing network structure in order to study the relative effects of different filtering methods. We show that cluster analysis and principal components are strongly affected by filtering. Filtering methods intended specifically for cluster and network analysis are introduced and compared by simulating modular networks with known statistical properties. To study more realistic situations, we analyze simulated "real" data based on well-characterized E. coli and S. cerevisiae regulatory networks. CONCLUSION: The methods introduced apply very generally, to any similarity matrix describing gene expression. One of the proposed methods, SUMCOV, performed well for all models simulated.},

@article{Balaji2006,
abstract = {Studies on various model systems have shown that a relatively small number of transcription factors can set up strikingly complex spatial and temporal patterns of gene expression. This is achieved mainly by means of combinatorial or differential gene regulation, i.e. regulation of a gene by two or more transcription factors simultaneously or under different conditions. While a number of specific molecular details of the mechanisms of combinatorial regulation have emerged, our understanding of the general principles of combinatorial regulation on a genomic scale is still limited. In this work, we approach this problem by using the largest assembled transcriptional regulatory network for yeast. A specific network transformation procedure was used to obtain the co-regulatory network describing the set of all significant associations among transcription factors in regulating common target genes. Analysis of the global properties of the co-regulatory network suggested the presence of two classes of regulatory hubs: (i) those that make many co-regulatory associations, thus serving as integrators of disparate cellular processes; and (ii) those that make few co-regulatory associations, and thereby specifically regulate one or a few major cellular processes. Investigation of the local structure of the co-regulatory network revealed a significantly higher than expected modular organization, which might have emerged as a result of selection by functional constraints. These constraints probably emerge from the need for extensive modular backup and the requirement to integrate transcriptional inputs of multiple distinct functional systems. We then explored the transcriptional control of three major regulatory systems (ubiquitin signaling, protein kinase and transcriptional regulation systems) to understand specific aspects of their upstream control. As a result, we observed that ubiquitin E3 ligases are regulated primarily by unique transcription factors, whereas E1 and E2 enzymes share common transcription factors to a much greater extent. This suggested that the deployment of E3s unique to specific functional contexts may be mediated significantly at the transcriptional level. Likewise, we were able to uncover evidence for much higher upstream transcription control of transcription factors themselves, in comparison to components of other regulatory systems. We believe that the results presented here might provide a framework for testing the role of co-regulatory associations in eukaryotic transcriptional control.},

abstract = {Since the completion of the genome sequence of Saccharomyces cerevisiae in 1996 (refs 1, 2), there has been a large increase in complete genome sequences, accompanied by great advances in our understanding of genome evolution. Although little is known about the natural and life histories of yeasts in the wild, there are an increasing number of studies looking at ecological and geographic distributions, population structure and sexual versus asexual reproduction. Less well understood at the whole genome level are the evolutionary processes acting within populations and species that lead to adaptation to different environments, phenotypic differences and reproductive isolation. Here we present one- to fourfold or more coverage of the genome sequences of over seventy isolates of the baker's yeast S. cerevisiae and its closest relative, Saccharomyces paradoxus. We examine variation in gene content, single nucleotide polymorphisms, nucleotide insertions and deletions, copy numbers and transposable elements. We find that phenotypic variation broadly correlates with global genome-wide phylogenetic relationships. S. paradoxus populations are well delineated along geographic boundaries, whereas the variation among worldwide S. cerevisiae isolates shows less differentiation and is comparable to a single S. paradoxus population. Rather than one or two domestication events leading to the extant baker's yeasts, the population structure of S. cerevisiae consists of a few well-defined, geographically isolated lineages and many different mosaics of these lineages, supporting the idea that human influence provided the opportunity for cross-breeding and production of new combinations of pre-existing variations.},

abstract = {The constraint-based reconstruction and analysis (COBRA) framework has been widely used to study steady-state flux solutions in genome-scale metabolic networks. One shortcoming of current COBRA methods is the possible violation of the loop law in the computed steady-state flux solutions. The loop law is analogous to Kirchhoff's second law for electric circuits, and states that at steady state there can be no net flux around a closed network cycle. Although the consequences of the loop law have been known for years, it has been computationally difficult to work with. Therefore, the resulting loop-law constraints have been overlooked. Here, we present a general mixed integer programming approach called loopless COBRA (ll-COBRA), which can be used to eliminate all steady-state flux solutions that are incompatible with the loop law. We apply this approach to improve flux predictions on three common COBRA methods: flux balance analysis, flux variability analysis, and Monte Carlo sampling of the flux space. Moreover, we demonstrate that the imposition of loop-law constraints with ll-COBRA improves the consistency of simulation results with experimental data. This method provides an additional constraint for many COBRA methods, enabling the acquisition of more realistic simulation results.},

abstract = {Epistasis refers to the phenomenon in which phenotypic consequences caused by mutation of one gene depend on one or more mutations at another gene. Epistasis is critical for understanding many genetic and evolutionary processes, including pathway organization, evolution of sexual reproduction, mutational load, ploidy, genomic complexity, speciation, and the origin of life. Nevertheless, current understandings for the genome-wide distribution of epistasis are mostly inferred from interactions among one mutant type per gene, whereas how epistatic interaction partners change dynamically for different mutant alleles of the same gene is largely unknown. Here we address this issue by combining predictions from flux balance analysis and data from a recently published high-throughput experiment. Our results show that different alleles can epistatically interact with very different gene sets. Furthermore, between two random mutant alleles of the same gene, the chance for the allele with more severe mutational consequence to develop a higher percentage of negative epistasis than the other allele is 50∼70\% in eukaryotic organisms, but only 20∼30\% in bacteria and archaea. We developed a population genetics model that predicts that the observed distribution for the sign of epistasis can speed up the process of purging deleterious mutations in eukaryotic organisms. Our results indicate that epistasis among genes can be dynamically rewired at the genome level, and call on future efforts to revisit theories that can integrate epistatic dynamics among genes in biological systems.},

abstract = {Glucose repression of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle in Saccharomyces cerevisiae was investigated under different environmental conditions using (13)C-tracer experiments. Real-time quantification of the volatile metabolites ethanol and CO(2) allowed accurate carbon balancing. In all experiments with the wild-type, a strong correlation between the rates of growth and glucose uptake was observed, indicating a constant yield of biomass. In contrast, glycerol and acetate production rates were less dependent on the rate of glucose uptake, but were affected by environmental conditions. The glycerol production rate was highest during growth in high-osmolarity medium (2.9 mmol g(-1) h(-1)), while the highest acetate production rate of 2.1 mmol g(-1) h(-1) was observed in alkaline medium of pH 6.9. Under standard growth conditions (25 g glucose l(-1) , pH 5.0, 30 degrees C) S. cerevisiae had low fluxes through the pentose phosphate pathway and the TCA cycle. A significant increase in TCA cycle activity from 0.03 mmol g(-1) h(-1) to about 1.7 mmol g(-1) h(-1) was observed when S. cerevisiae grew more slowly as a result of environmental perturbations, including unfavourable pH values and sodium chloride stress. Compared to experiments with high glucose uptake rates, the ratio of CO(2) to ethanol increased more than 50 \%, indicating an increase in flux through the TCA cycle. Although glycolysis and the ethanol production pathway still exhibited the highest fluxes, the net flux through the TCA cycle increased significantly with decreasing glucose uptake rates. Results from experiments with single gene deletion mutants partially impaired in glucose repression (hxk2, grr1) indicated that the rate of glucose uptake correlates with this increase in TCA cycle flux. These findings are discussed in the context of regulation of glucose repression.},

In particular, these models assume that the distribution of fitness effects among new mutations is in the domain of attraction of the so-called Gumbel-type extreme value distribution. This assumption has not, however, been justified on any biological or theoretical grounds. In this note, I study random mutation in one of the simplest models of mutation and adaptation-Fisher's geometric model. I show that random mutation in this model yields a distribution of mutational effects that belongs to the Gumbel type. I also show that the distribution of fitness effects among rare beneficial mutations in Fisher's model is asymptotically exponential. I confirm these analytic findings with exact computer simulations. These results provide some support for the use of Gumbel-type extreme value theory in studies of adaptation and point to a surprising connection between recent phenotypic- and sequence-based models of adaptation: in both, the distribution of fitness effects among rare beneficial mutations is approximately exponential.},

However, this metaphor, with its emphasis on adaptive peaks and valleys, is to a large degree a reflection of our three-dimensional experience. Both genotypes and phenotypes of biological organisms differ in numerous characteristics, and, thus, the dimension of ‘real’ adaptive landscapes is much larger than three. Properties of multidimensional adaptive landscapes are very different from those of low dimension. Consequently, something that is seen as a theoretical challenge in a low-dimensional case might be a trivial problem in a multidimensional context and vice versa. In particular, the problem of how a population crosses an adaptive valley on its way from one adaptive peak to another, which Wright attempted to solve with his shifting balance theory, may be non-existent. A new framework is emerging for deepening our understanding of evolution and speciation, which provides a plausible multidimensional alternative to the conventional view of rugged adaptive landscapes.},

abstract = {It is possible to infer aspects of an organism's lifestyle from its gene content. Can the reverse also be done? Here we consider this issue by modelling evolution of the reduced genomes of endosymbiotic bacteria. The diversity of gene content in these bacteria may reflect both variation in selective forces and contingency-dependent loss of alternative pathways. Using an in silico representation of the metabolic network of Escherichia coli, we examine the role of contingency by repeatedly simulating the successive loss of genes while controlling for the environment. The minimal networks that result are variable in both gene content and number. Partially different metabolisms can thus evolve owing to contingency alone. The simulation outcomes do preserve a core metabolism, however, which is over-represented in strict intracellular bacteria. Moreover, differences between minimal networks based on lifestyle are predictable: by simulating their respective environmental conditions, we can model evolution of the gene content in Buchnera aphidicola and Wigglesworthia glossinidia with over 80\% accuracy.

abstract = {In this chapter, we will review how signal transduction pathways have been assembled in the past, bringing us to our present understanding of this area of research. The methods employed have relied heavily upon the genetics of yeast, worms, flies, mice, and humans. The use of second site suppressors and epistasis has permitted the detection of interacting elements and the sequence of genetic activities. Biochemistry has been employed to elucidate metabolic pathways, demonstrate protein complexes, and identify functions of gene products. The tools of molecular biology-knocking concentration of protein products down or up-have been helpful to trace the function of pathways in vivo. The study of disease states has led to the identification of a set of altered genes and helped define a network that is altered and gives rise to the disease. We will also discuss some serious limitations in these approaches. After reviewing how signal transduction pathways are constructed and investigated, we will turn our attention to an example that demonstrates the inter-relationships between pathways and the regulation of a specific set of pathways. We will examine how the p53 pathway in responding to stress shuts down the AKT-1 and mTOR pathways so as to limit the error frequency of cell growth and division during a stressful time where homeostatic mechanisms are required to respond and increase the fidelity of these processes.},

abstract = {We are developing a dual panel breast-dedicated PET system using LSO scintillators coupled to position sensitive avalanche photodiodes (PSAPD). The charge output is amplified and read using NOVA RENA-3 ASICs. This paper shows that the coincidence timing resolution of the RENA-3 ASIC can be improved using certain list-mode calibrations. We treat the calibration problem as a convex optimization problem and use the RENA-3s analog-based timing system to correct the measured data for time dispersion effects from correlated noise, PSAPD signal delays and varying signal amplitudes. The direct solution to the optimization problem involves a matrix inversion that grows order (n3) with the number of parameters. An iterative method using single-coordinate descent to approximate the inversion grows order (n). The inversion does not need to run to convergence, since any gains at high iteration number will be low compared to noise amplification. The system calibration method is demonstrated with measured pulser data as well as with two LSO-PSAPD detectors in electronic coincidence. After applying the algorithm, the 511keV photopeak paired coincidence time resolution from the LSO-PSAPD detectors under study improved by 57\%, from the raw value of 16.3±0.07 ns FWHM to 6.92±0.02 ns FWHM (11.52±0.05 ns to 4.89±0.02 ns for unpaired photons).},

The first genome-scale metabolic reconstruction for a eukaryotic cell, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, consisting of 1,175 metabolic reactions and 733 metabolites, has appeared. A constraint-based in silico analysis procedure was used to compute properties of the S. cerevisiae metabolic network. The computed number of ATP molecules produced per pair of electrons donated to the electron transport system (ETS) and energy-maintenance requirements were quantitatively in agreement with experimental results. Computed whole-cell functions of growth and metabolic by-product secretion in aerobic and anaerobic culture were consistent with experimental data, and thus mRNA expression profiles during metabolic shifts were computed. The computed consequences of gene knockouts on growth phenotypes were consistent with experimental observations. Thus, constraint-based analysis of a genome-scale metabolic network for the eukaryotic S. cerevisiae allows for computation of its integrated functions, producing in silico results that were consistent with observed phenotypic functions for approximately 70-80\% of the conditions considered.},

abstract = {Advances in the field of bioinformatics have led to reconstruction of genome-scale networks for a number of key organisms. The application of physicochemical constraints to these stoichiometric networks allows researchers, through methods such as flux balance analysis, to highlight key sets of reactions necessary to achieve particular objectives. The key benefits of constraint-based analysis lie in the minimal knowledge required to infer systemic properties. However, network degeneracy leads to a large number of flux distributions that satisfy any objective; moreover, these distributions may be dominated by biologically irrelevant internal cycles. By examining the geometry underlying the problem, we define two methods for finding a unique solution within the space of all possible flux distributions; such a solution contains no internal cycles, and is representative of the space as a whole. The first method draws on typical geometric knowledge, but cannot be applied to large networks because of the high computational complexity of the problem. Thus a second method, an iteration of linear programs which scales easily to the genome scale, is defined. The algorithm is run on four recent genome-scale models, and unique flux solutions are found. The algorithm set out here will allow researchers in flux balance analysis to exchange typical solutions to their models in a reproducible format. Moreover, having found a single solution, statistical analyses such as correlations may be performed.},

@article{Kundaje2007,
abstract = {Inferring gene regulatory networks from high-throughput genomic data is one of the central problems in computational biology. In this paper, we describe a predictive modeling approach for studying regulatory networks, based on a machine learning algorithm called MEDUSA. MEDUSA integrates promoter sequence, mRNA expression, and transcription factor occupancy data to learn gene regulatory programs that predict the differential expression of target genes. Instead of using clustering or correlation of expression profiles to infer regulatory relationships, MEDUSA determines condition-specific regulators and discovers regulatory motifs that mediate the regulation of target genes. In this way, MEDUSA meaningfully models biological mechanisms of transcriptional regulation. MEDUSA solves the problem of predicting the differential (up/down) expression of target genes by using boosting, a technique from statistical learning, which helps to avoid overfitting as the algorithm searches through the high-dimensional space of potential regulators and sequence motifs. Experimental results demonstrate that MEDUSA achieves high prediction accuracy on held-out experiments (test data), that is, data not seen in training. We also present context-specific analysis of MEDUSA regulatory programs for DNA damage and hypoxia, demonstrating that MEDUSA identifies key regulators and motifs in these processes. A central challenge in the field is the difficulty of validating reverse-engineered networks in the absence of a gold standard. Our approach of learning regulatory programs provides at least a partial solution for the problem: MEDUSA's prediction accuracy on held-out data gives a concrete and statistically sound way to validate how well the algorithm performs. With MEDUSA, statistical validation becomes a prerequisite for hypothesis generation and network building rather than a secondary consideration.},

abstract = {The complete nucleotide sequences of rat M1- and M2-type pyruvate kinase mRNAs were determined by sequencing the cDNAs and by analyses of S1 nuclease mapping and primer extension. The sequences have an identical molecular size of about 2220 nucleotides excluding a poly(A) tail and include 1593-nucleotide coding region. Their nucleotide sequences are identical except for 160-nucleotide sequences within the coding regions. The amino acid sequences of the M1- and M2-type subunits deduced from the cDNA sequences differ by only 45 residues within domain C, which constitutes the main region responsible for intersubunit contact. The sequence of this region of the M2-type shows higher homology than that of the M1-type with the corresponding sequence of the L-type. Since the M2- and L-types are allosteric enzymes, unlike to the M1-type, the residues common to the M2- and L-types, but not the M1-type may be important for mediating the allosteric properties. Genomic clones encoding both M1- and M2-type isozyme mRNAs were isolated. By partial sequence analysis of a clone lambda MPK37 four exons were identified, of which two adjacent exons coded the M1- and M2-specific sequences, respectively. The two remaining exons present downstream coded amino acids common to the two isozymes. Thus, we conclude that the M1- and M2-type isozymes of pyruvate kinase are produced from the same gene probably by alternative RNA splicing.},

It has been thought that differentiated postmitotic cells have their genomes hard wired, with little ability for phenotypic plasticity. Here we show that transfer of the transcriptome from differentiated rat astrocytes into a nondividing differentiated rat neuron resulted in the conversion of the neuron into a functional astrocyte-like cell in a time-dependent manner. This single-cell study permits high resolution of molecular and functional components that underlie phenotype identity. The RNA population from astrocytes contains RNAs in the appropriate relative abundances that give rise to regulatory RNAs and translated proteins that enable astrocyte identity. When transferred into the postmitotic neuron, the astrocyte RNA population converts 44\% of the neuronal host cells into the destination astrocyte-like phenotype. In support of this observation, quantitative measures of cellular morphology, single-cell PCR, single-cell microarray, and single-cell functional analyses have been performed. The host-cell phenotypic changes develop over many weeks and are persistent. We call this process of RNA-induced phenotype changes, transcriptome-induced phenotype remodeling.},

We demonstrate that by combining these data with information on protein-protein, prote in-DNA or metabolic networks, it is possible to uncover physical mechanisms behind many of the observed genetic effects. Using a probabilistic model, we found that 1,922 genetic interactions are significantly associated with either between- or within-pathway explanations encoded in the physical networks, covering approximately 40\% of known genetic interactions. These models predict new functions for 343 proteins and suggest that between-pathway explanations are better than within-pathway explanations at interpreting genetic interactions identified in systematic screens.

abstract = {Mutation hotspots are commonly observed in genomic sequences and certain human disease loci, but general mechanisms for their formation remain elusive. Here we investigate the distribution of single-nucleotide changes around insertions/deletions (indels) in six independent genome comparisons, including primates, rodents, fruitfly, rice and yeast. In each of these genomic comparisons, nucleotide divergence (D) is substantially elevated surrounding indels and decreases monotonically to near-background levels over several hundred bases. D is significantly correlated with both size and abundance of nearby indels. In comparisons of closely related species, derived nucleotide substitutions surrounding indels occur in significantly greater numbers in the lineage containing the indel than in the one containing the ancestral (non-indel) allele; the same holds within species for single-nucleotide mutations surrounding polymorphic indels. We propose that heterozygosity for an indel is mutagenic to surrounding sequences, and use yeast genome-wide polymorphism data to estimate the increase in mutation rate. The consistency of these patterns within and between species suggests that indel-associated substitution is a general mutational mechanism.},

abstract = {The reverse engineering of biochemical networks is a central problem in systems biology. In recent years several methods have been developed for this purpose, using techniques from a variety of fields. A systematic comparison of the different methods is complicated by their widely varying data requirements, making benchmarking difficult. Also, because of the lack of detailed knowledge about most real networks, it is not easy to use experimental data for this purpose. This paper contains a comparison of four reverse-engineering methods using data from a simulated network. The network is sufficiently realistic and complex to include many of the challenges that data from real networks pose. Our results indicate that the two methods based on genetic perturbations of the network outperform the other methods, including dynamic Bayesian networks and a partial correlation method.},

abstract = {Data Sets used in reverse engineering of biochemical networks contain usually relatively few high-dimensional data points, which makes the problem in general vastly underdetermined. It is therefore important to estimate the probability that a given algorithm will return a model of acceptable quality when run on a data set of small size but high dimension. We propose a mathematical framework for investigating such questions. We then demonstrate that without assuming any prior biological knowledge, in general no theoretical distinction between the performance of different algorithms can be made. We also give an example of how expected algorithm performance can in principle be altered by utilizing certain features of the data collection protocol. We conclude with some examples of theorems that were proven within the proposed framework.},

abstract = {Signal transduction networks are crucial for inter- and intra-cellular signaling. Signals are often transmitted via covalent modification of protein structure, with phosphorylation/dephosphorylation as the primary example. In this paper, we apply a recently described method of computational algebra to the modeling of signaling networks, based on time-course protein modification data. Computational algebraic techniques are employed to construct next-state functions. A Monte Carlo method is used to approximate the Deegan-Packel Index of Power corresponding to the respective variables. The Deegan-Packel Index of Power is used to conjecture dependencies in the cellular signaling networks. We apply this method to two examples of protein modification time-course data available in the literature. These experiments identified protein carbonylation upon exposure of cells to sub-lethal concentrations of copper. We demonstrate that this method can identify protein dependencies that might correspond to regulatory mechanisms to shut down glycolysis in a reverse, step-wise fashion in response to copper-induced oxidative stress in yeast. These examples show that the computational algebra approach can identify dependencies that may outline signaling networks involved in the response of glycolytic enzymes to the oxidative stress caused by copper.},

These priors, either separately or combined, have the potential of reducing the complexity of reverse-engineering regulatory networks while creating more robust and reliable models.

To accomplish this formidable task, the availability of an accurate map of the physical interactions in the cell that are responsible for cellular behavior and function would be exceedingly helpful, as these data are ultimately the result of such molecular interactions. However, all we have at this time is, at best, a fragmentary and only partially correct representation of the interactions between genes, their byproducts, and other cellular entities. If we want to succeed in our quest for understanding the biological whole as more than the sum of the individual parts, we need to build more comprehensive and cell-context-specific maps of the biological interaction networks.

abstract = {Cell perturbation data are a very important resource to analyze and reconstruct cell-signaling networks. To facilitate the utilization of this type of data and enable large-scale and automated network reconstruction effort, we have already developed a data structure for storing cell perturbation results and deducing perturbation networks (CellFrame). For automating network analysis, we here propose a computational method called the "alternative pathway approach" (ALPA) in this work. This method can validate the signaling networks with conditional perturbation data extracted from published experiments, and can suggest additional tests to improve the network. It searches the alternative pathway space between all pairs of nodes, constructs pathnets (set of pathways between two nodes) and validates the network edges using conditional perturbation. For pathnets without conditional data, experiments with the fewest number of perturbations or the most parsimonious are designed. For pathnets without experimentally derived or detected pair-wise interactions, ALPA can predict the potential effects or propose additional pathways to expand the existing network. We have tested the ALPA method on the TNFalpha-MAPK signaling cascade; the reconstructed network is consistent with the consensus model. We also used the ALPA algorithm to analyze a yeast gene perturbation network, using the data from the Rosetta compendium of expression profiles, which demonstrates that it can be also used for large-scale analysis. We compared the performance of the ALPA approach with Boolean and Bayesian network algorithms for their efficiency and accuracy, respectively, in network construction.},

Biochemistry has been employed to elucidate metabolic pathways, demonstrate protein complexes, and identify functions of gene products. The tools of molecular biology-knocking concentration of protein products down or up-have been helpful to trace the function of pathways in vivo. The study of disease states has led to the identification of a set of altered genes and helped define a network that is altered and gives rise to the disease. We will also discuss some serious limitations in these approaches. After reviewing how signal transduction pathways are constructed and investigated, we will turn our attention to an example that demonstrates the inter-relationships between pathways and the regulation of a specific set of pathways.

abstract = {Since the advent of gene expression microarray technology more than 10 years ago, many computational approaches have been developed aimed at using statistical associations between mRNA abundance profiles to predict transcriptional regulatory interactions. The ultimate goal is to develop causal network models describing the transcriptional influences that genes exert on each other (via their protein products), which can be used to predict network disruptions (e.g., mutations) leading to a disease phenotype, as well as the appropriate therapeutic intervention. However, microarray data measure only a small component of the interacting variables in a genetic regulatory network, as cells are known to regulate gene expression via many diverse mechanisms. Although many researchers have acknowledged the questionable interpretation of statistical dependencies between mRNA profiles, very little work has been done on theoretically characterizing the nature of inferred dependencies using models that account for unobserved interacting variables. In this work, we review the theory behind reverse engineering algorithms derived from three separate disciplines-system control theory, graphical models, and information theory-and highlight several mathematical relationships between the various methods. We then apply recent theoretical work on constructing graphical models with latent variables to the context of reverse engineering genetic networks. We demonstrate that even the addition of simple latent variables induces statistical dependencies between non-directly interacting (e.g., co-regulated) genes that cannot be eliminated by conditioning on any observed variables.},

abstract = {Predicting protein-protein interactions has become a key step of reverse-engineering biological networks to better understand cellular functions. The experimental methods in determining protein-protein interactions are time-consuming and costly, which has motivated vigorous development of computational approaches for predicting protein-protein interactions. A set of recently developed bioinformatics methods utilizes coevolutionary information of the interacting partners (e.g., as exhibited in the form of correlations between distance matrices, where, for each protein, a matrix stores the pairwise distances between the protein and its orthologs in a group of reference genomes). We proposed a novel method to account for the intra-matrix correlations in improving predictive accuracy. The distance matrices for a pair of proteins are transformed and concatenated into a phylogenetic vector. A least-squares support vector machine is trained and tested on pairs of proteins, represented as phylogenetic vectors, whose interactions are known. The intra-matrix correlations are accounted for by introducing a weighted linear kernel, which determines the dot product of two phylogenetic vectors. The performance, measured as receiver operator characteristic (ROC) score in cross-validation experiments, shows significant improvement of our method (ROC score 0.928) over that obtained by Pearson correlations (0.659).},

abstract = {A major challenge in systems biology is to evaluate the feasibility of a biological research project prior to its realization. Since experiments are animals-, cost- and time-consuming, approaches allowing researchers to discriminate alternative hypotheses with a minimal set of experiments are highly desirable. Given a null hypothesis and alternative model, as well as laboratory constraints like observable players, sample size, noise level, and stimulation options, we suggest a method to obtain a list of required experiments in order to significantly reject the null hypothesis model M0 if a specified alternative model MA is realized. For this purpose, we estimate the power to detect a violation of M0 by means of Monte Carlo simulations. Iteratively, the power is maximized over all feasible stimulations of the system using multi-experiment fitting, leading to an optimal combination of experimental settings to discriminate the null hypothesis and alternative model. We prove the importance of simultaneous modeling of combined experiments with quantitative, highly sampled in vivo measurements from the Jak/STAT5 signaling pathway in fibroblasts, stimulated with erythropoietin (Epo). Afterwards we apply the presented iterative experimental design approach to the Jak/STAT3 pathway of primary hepatocytes stimulated with IL-6. Our approach offers the possibility of deciding which scientific questions can be answered based on existing laboratory constraints. To be able to concentrate on feasible questions on account of inexpensive computational simulations yields not only enormous cost and time saving, but also helps to specify realizable, systematic research projects in advance.},

abstract = {Aerobic glycolysis is a seemingly wasteful mode of ATP production that is seen both in rapidly proliferating mammalian cells and highly active contracting muscles, but whether there is a common origin for its presence in these widely different systems is unknown. To study this issue, here we develop a model of human central metabolism that incorporates a solvent capacity constraint of metabolic enzymes and mitochondria, accounting for their occupied volume densities, while assuming glucose and/or fatty acid utilization. The model demonstrates that activation of aerobic glycolysis is favored above a threshold metabolic rate in both rapidly proliferating cells and heavily contracting muscles, because it provides higher ATP yield per volume density than mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. In the case of muscle physiology, the model also predicts that before the lactate switch, fatty acid oxidation increases, reaches a maximum, and then decreases to zero with concomitant increase in glucose utilization, in agreement with the empirical evidence. These results are further corroborated by a larger scale model, including biosynthesis of major cell biomass components. The larger scale model also predicts that in proliferating cells the lactate switch is accompanied by activation of glutaminolysis, another distinctive feature of the Warburg effect. In conclusion, intracellular molecular crowding is a fundamental constraint for cell metabolism in both rapidly proliferating- and non-proliferating cells with high metabolic demand. Addition of this constraint to metabolic flux balance models can explain several observations of mammalian cell metabolism under steady state conditions.},

abstract = {Within the last decades NMR spectroscopy has undergone tremendous development and has become a powerful analytical tool for the investigation of intracellular flux distributions in biochemical networks using (13)C-labeled substrates. Not only are the experiments much easier to conduct than experiments employing radioactive tracer elements, but NMR spectroscopy also provides additional information on the labeling pattern of the metabolites. Whereas the maximum amount of information obtainable with (14)C-labeled substrates is the fractional enrichment in the individual carbon atom positions, NMR spectroscopy can also provide information on the degree of labeling at neighboring carbon atom positions by analyzing multiplet patterns in NMR spectra or using 2-dimensional NMR spectra. It is possible to quantify the mole fractions of molecules that show a specific labeling pattern, i.e., information of the isotopomer distribution in metabolite pools can be obtained. The isotopomer distribution is the maximum amount of information that in theory can be obtained from (13)C-tracer studies. The wealth of information contained in NMR spectra frequently leads to overdetermined algebraic systems. Consequently, fluxes must be estimated by nonlinear least squares analysis, in which experimental labeling data is compared with simulated steady state isotopomer distributions. Hence, mathematical models are required to compute the steady state isotopomer distribution as a function of a given set of steady state fluxes. Because 2(n) possible labeling patterns exist in a molecule of n carbon atoms, and each pattern corresponds to a separate state in the isotopomer model, these models are inherently complex. Model complexity, so far, has restricted usage of isotopomer information to relatively small metabolic networks. A general methodology for the formulation of isotopomer models is described. The model complexity of isotopomer models is reduced to that of classical metabolic models by expressing the 2(n) isotopomer mass balances of a metabolite pool in a single matrix equation.

abstract = {A new form of metabolic flux analysis (MFA) called thermodynamics-based metabolic flux analysis (TMFA) is introduced with the capability of generating thermodynamically feasible flux and metabolite activity profiles on a genome scale. TMFA involves the use of a set of linear thermodynamic constraints in addition to the mass balance constraints typically used in MFA. TMFA produces flux distributions that do not contain any thermodynamically infeasible reactions or pathways, and it provides information about the free energy change of reactions and the range of metabolite activities in addition to reaction fluxes. TMFA is applied to study the thermodynamically feasible ranges for the fluxes and the Gibbs free energy change, Delta(r)G', of the reactions and the activities of the metabolites in the genome-scale metabolic model of Escherichia coli developed by Palsson and co-workers. In the TMFA of the genome scale model, the metabolite activities and reaction Delta(r)G' are able to achieve a wide range of values at optimal growth. The reaction dihydroorotase is identified as a possible thermodynamic bottleneck in E. coli metabolism with a Delta(r)G' constrained close to zero while numerous reactions are identified throughout metabolism for which Delta(r)G' is always highly negative regardless of metabolite concentrations. As it has been proposed previously, these reactions with exclusively negative Delta(r)G' might be candidates for cell regulation, and we find that a significant number of these reactions appear to be the first steps in the linear portion of numerous biosynthesis pathways. The thermodynamically feasible ranges for the concentration ratios ATP/ADP, NAD(P)/NAD(P)H, and H(extracellular)(+)/H(intracellular)(+) are also determined and found to encompass the values observed experimentally in every case. Further, we find that the NAD/NADH and NADP/NADPH ratios maintained in the cell are close to the minimum feasible ratio and maximum feasible ratio, respectively.},

However, it is not known whether the predicted pathway usage in FBA solutions is consistent with gene and protein expression in the wild-type and evolved strains. Here, we report that >98\% of active reactions from FBA optimal growth solutions are supported by transcriptomic and proteomic data. Moreover, when E. coli adapts to growth rate selective pressure, the evolved strains upregulate genes within the optimal growth predictions, and downregulate genes outside of the optimal growth solutions. In addition, bottlenecks from dosage limitations of computationally predicted essential genes are overcome in the evolved strains. We also identify regulatory processes that may contribute to the development of the optimal growth phenotype in the evolved strains, such as the downregulation of known regulons and stringent response suppression. Thus, differential gene and protein expression from wild-type and adaptively evolved strains supports observed growth phenotype changes, and is consistent with GEM-computed optimal growth states.},

abstract = {The remarkable advance in sequencing technology and the rising interest in medical and environmental microbiology, biotechnology, and synthetic biology resulted in a deluge of published microbial genomes. Yet, genome annotation, comparison, and modeling remain a major bottleneck to the translation of sequence information into biological knowledge, hence computational analysis tools are continuously being developed for rapid genome annotation and interpretation. Among the earliest, most comprehensive resources for prokaryotic genome analysis, the SEED project, initiated in 2003 as an integration of genomic data and analysis tools, now contains >5,000 complete genomes, a constantly updated set of curated annotations embodied in a large and growing collection of encoded subsystems, a derived set of protein families, and hundreds of genome-scale metabolic models. Until recently, however, maintaining current copies of the SEED code and data at remote locations has been a pressing issue. To allow high-performance remote access to the SEED database, we developed the SEED Servers (http://www.theseed.org/servers): four network-based servers intended to expose the data in the underlying relational database, support basic annotation services, offer programmatic access to the capabilities of the RAST annotation server, and provide access to a growing collection of metabolic models that support flux balance analysis. The SEED servers offer open access to regularly updated data, the ability to annotate prokaryotic genomes, the ability to create metabolic reconstructions and detailed models of metabolism, and access to hundreds of existing metabolic models. This work offers and supports a framework upon which other groups can build independent research efforts. Large integrations of genomic data represent one of the major intellectual resources driving research in biology, and programmatic access to the SEED data will provide significant utility to a broad collection of potential users.},

Measurements are based on the kinetics of cellular incorporation of stable isotope from nutrient into downstream metabolites. At multiple time points, after cells are rapidly switched from unlabeled to isotope-labeled nutrient, metabolism is quenched, metabolites are extracted and the extract is analyzed by chromatography-mass spectrometry. Resulting plots of unlabeled compound versus time follow variants of exponential decay, with the flux equal to the decay rate multiplied by the intracellular metabolite concentration. Because labeling is typically fast (t(1/2)<or=5 min for central metabolites in Escherichia coli), variations on this approach can effectively probe dynamically changing metabolic fluxes. This protocol is exemplified using E. coli and nitrogen labeling, for which quantitative flux data for approximately 15 metabolites can be obtained over 3 d of work. Applications to adherent mammalian cells are also discussed.},

abstract = {Genome-scale metabolic networks can now be reconstructed based on annotated genomic data augmented with biochemical and physiological information about the organism. Mathematical analysis can be performed to assess the capabilities of these reconstructed networks. The constraints-based framework, with flux balance analysis (FBA), has been used successfully to predict time course of growth and by-product secretion, effects of mutation and knock-outs, and gene expression profiles. However, FBA leads to incorrect predictions in situations where regulatory effects are a dominant influence on the behavior of the organism. Thus, there is a need to include regulatory events within FBA to broaden its scope and predictive capabilities. Here we represent transcriptional regulatory events as time-dependent constraints on the capabilities of a reconstructed metabolic network to further constrain the space of possible network functions. Using a simplified metabolic/regulatory network, growth is simulated under various conditions to illustrate systemic effects such as catabolite repression, the aerobic/anaerobic diauxic shift and amino acid biosynthesis pathway repression. The incorporation of transcriptional regulatory events in FBA enables us to interpret, analyse and predict the effects of transcriptional regulation on cellular metabolism at the systemic level.},

We have constructed a genome-scale metabolic model of Escherichia coli based on the iJR904 model developed by the Palsson Laboratory at the University of California at San Diego. Group contribution methods were utilized to estimate the standard Gibbs free energy change of every reaction in the constructed model. Reactions in the model were classified based on the activity of the reactions during optimal growth on glucose in aerobic media. The most thermodynamically unfavorable reactions involved in the production of biomass in E. coli were identified as ATP phosphoribosyltransferase, ATP synthase, methylene-tetra-hydrofolate dehydrogenase, and tryptophanase. The effect of a knockout of these reactions on the production of biomass and the production of individual biomass precursors was analyzed. Changes in the distribution of fluxes in the cell after knockout of these unfavorable reactions were also studied. The methodologies and results discussed can be used to facilitate the refinement of the feasible ranges for cellular parameters such as species concentrations and reaction rate constants.},

Time-dependent intracellular concentrations of nucleoside di- and triphosphates, Pi, and sugar phosphates were measured during glycolysis with 2-min resolution, while intracellular and extra-cellular pH values were monitored simultaneously. Upon glucose addition, anaerobic E. coli cells rapidly produce acids and develop a transmembrane pH gradient (delta pH). Glycolysis rates were calculated from the changes in the external pH. It was found that glycolysis rates are strongly dependent on internal pH, sharply decreasing when the pH drops below approximately 7.2. The ATPase inhibitor, dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD), prevented NTP hydrolysis and inhibited delta pH formation. The uncoupler, carbonyl cyanide p-triflouromethoxyphenyl hydrazone (FCCP), drastically reduced both the delta pH and the NTP level. When the cells were previously treated with DCCD, FCCP collapsed the delta pH while the NTP levels remained high. It is concluded that ATP produced by glycolysis is hydrolyzed by the membrane ATPase to generate a delta pH and that FCCP stimulates ATP hydrolysis by ATPase and collapses the proton gradient.},

Glutamate, isolated from liver extracts, is enzymatically or chemically converted to gamma-aminobutyrate, alpha-hydroxyglutarate, isocitrate, and glutamine before mass spectrometric analysis. General equations have been developed ("Appendix I") to determine the isotopic enrichment of each carbon of glutamate from the isotopic enrichment of fragments obtained from the mass spectra of trimethylsilyl or t-butyldimethylsilyl derivatives of glutamate and of derived compounds ("Appendix II"). In the presence of octanoate, (i) the rate of the citric acid cycle decreases from 0.25 to 0.13 mumol/min x g wet weight which are one-third and one-sixth of the rate of pyruvate carboxylation, and (ii) the rate of gluconeogenesis increases from 0.65 to 0.83 mumol/min x g wet weight. The rate of pyruvate carboxylation is 13 and 34-fold faster than that of pyruvate dehydrogenation in the absence or presence of octanoate, respectively. The rate of oxaloacetate to fumarate interconversion is at least six times greater than that of the citric acid cycle. Our data closely agree with those obtained by Magnusson et al. who used a non-invasive "chemical biopsy" of the human liver and support the use of labeled lactate and/or pyruvate for tracing hepatic metabolism in vivo.},

abstract = {Many bacterial systems rely on dynamic genetic circuits to control crucial biological processes. A major goal of systems biology is to understand these behaviours in terms of individual genes and their interactions. However, traditional techniques based on population averages 'wash out' crucial dynamics that are either unsynchronized between cells or are driven by fluctuations, or 'noise', in cellular components. Recently, the combination of time-lapse microscopy, quantitative image analysis and fluorescent protein reporters has enabled direct observation of multiple cellular components over time in individual cells. In conjunction with mathematical modelling, these techniques are now providing powerful insights into genetic circuit behaviour in diverse microbial systems.},

abstract = {Infusion of 13C-labeled lactate into rabbits and the subsequent measurement of glutamate isotopomers by 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy enables one to calculate relative flow rates associated with the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, albeit with a lower precision than one would obtain using a perfused organ. Two factors contribute to the lower precision in the determination of relative flow rates for the in vivo system: 1) a poorly defined pyruvate input and 2) low levels of 13C-enriched oxaloacetate and acetyl-CoA isotopomers, which give rise to weaker glutamate isotopomer NMR signals. To help overcome these limitations, we introduce a procedure to 1) include experimental data from gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and 2) account for the uncertainty in the labeling of the input to pyruvate by creating the labeling as a measurement that is subject to measurement error. The effects of the uncertainties in the input labeling, NMR data, and MS data are evaluated via a Monte Carlo method. The change in the precision of the relative fluxes for the cases of high/low NMR and high/low MS precision is given. An uncertainty in the lactate measurements of up to 10\% does not add significantly to the imprecision of the relative flow rates.},

Although several genome-scale network reconstructions describe Saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolism, they differ in scope and content, and use different terminologies to describe the same chemical entities. This makes comparisons between them difficult and underscores the desirability of a consolidated metabolic network that collects and formalizes the 'community knowledge' of yeast metabolism. We describe how we have produced a consensus metabolic network reconstruction for S. cerevisiae. In drafting it, we placed special emphasis on referencing molecules to persistent databases or using database-independent forms, such as SMILES or InChI strings, as this permits their chemical structure to be represented unambiguously and in a manner that permits automated reasoning. The reconstruction is readily available via a publicly accessible database and in the Systems Biology Markup Language (http://www.comp-sys-bio.org/yeastnet). It can be maintained as a resource that serves as a common denominator for studying the systems biology of yeast.

Guided by this analogy, we show that reaction networks can be formally re-cast as systems of interacting reactions that optimize the use of the available compounds by competing for substrates, akin to agents competing for a limited resource in an optimal allocation problem. As an illustration, we analyze the scenario that emerges in two simple cases: that of toy (random) reaction networks and that of a metabolic network model of the human red blood cell.},

Extending our earlier study on single knockouts [Wilhelm, T., Behre, J., Schuster, S., 2004. Analysis of structural robustness of metabolic networks. IEE Proc. Syst. Biol. 1(1), 114-120], we are now considering the general case of double and multiple knockouts. The robustness measures are based on the ratio of the number of remaining EFMs after knockout vs. the number of EFMs in the unperturbed situation, averaged over all combinations of knockouts. With the help of simple examples we demonstrate that consideration of multiple knockouts yields additional information going beyond single-knockout results. It is proven that the robustness score decreases as the knockout depth increases. We apply our extended framework to metabolic networks representing amino acid anabolism in Escherichia coli and human hepatocytes, and the central metabolism in human erythrocytes. Moreover, in the E. coli model the two subnetworks synthesising amino acids that are essential and those that are non-essential for humans are studied separately. The results are discussed from an evolutionary viewpoint. We find that E. coli has the most robust metabolism of all the cell types studied here. Considering only the subnetwork of the synthesis of non-essential amino acids, E. coli and the human hepatocyte show about the same robustness.},

The first genome-scale metabolic reconstruction for a eukaryotic cell, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, consisting of 1,175 metabolic reactions and 733 metabolites, has appeared. A constraint-based in silico analysis procedure was used to compute properties of the S. cerevisiae metabolic network. The computed number of ATP molecules produced per pair of electrons donated to the electron transport system (ETS) and energy-maintenance requirements were quantitatively in agreement with experimental results. Computed whole-cell functions of growth and metabolic by-product secretion in aerobic and anaerobic culture were consistent with experimental data, and thus mRNA expression profiles during metabolic shifts were computed. The computed consequences of gene knockouts on growth phenotypes were consistent with experimental observations. Thus, constraint-based analysis of a genome-scale metabolic network for the eukaryotic S. cerevisiae allows for computation of its integrated functions, producing in silico results that were consistent with observed phenotypic functions for approximately 70-80\% of the conditions considered.},

abstract = {Prediction of metabolic changes that result from genetic or environmental perturbations has several important applications, including diagnosing metabolic disorders and discovering novel drug targets. A cardinal challenge in obtaining accurate predictions is the integration of transcriptional regulatory networks with the corresponding metabolic network. We propose a method called probabilistic regulation of metabolism (PROM) that achieves this synthesis and enables straightforward, automated, and quantitative integration of high-throughput data into constraint-based modeling, making it an ideal tool for constructing genome-scale regulatory-metabolic network models for less-studied organisms. PROM introduces probabilities to represent gene states and gene-transcription factor interactions. By using PROM, we constructed an integrated regulatory-metabolic network for the model organism, Escherichia coli, and demonstrated that our method based on automated inference is more accurate and comprehensive than the current state of the art, which is based on manual curation of literature. After validating the approach, we used PROM to build a genome-scale integrated metabolic-regulatory model for Mycobacterium tuberculosis, a critically important human pathogen. This study incorporated data from more than 1,300 microarrays, 2,000 transcription factor-target interactions regulating 3,300 metabolic reactions, and 1,905 KO phenotypes for E. coli and M. tuberculosis. PROM identified KO phenotypes with accuracies as high as 95\%, and predicted growth rates quantitatively with correlation of 0.95. Importantly, PROM represents the successful integration of a top-down reconstructed, statistically inferred regulatory network with a bottom-up reconstructed, biochemically detailed metabolic network, bridging two important classes of systems biology models that are rarely combined quantitatively.},

Here, we present version 6 of the consensus yeast metabolic network (Yeast 6) as an update to the community effort to computationally reconstruct the genome-scale metabolic network of Saccharomyces cerevisiae S288c. Yeast 6 comprises 1458 metabolites participating in 1888 reactions, which are annotated with 900 yeast genes encoding the catalyzing enzymes. Compared with Yeast 5, Yeast 6 demonstrates improved sensitivity, specificity and positive and negative predictive values for predicting gene essentiality in glucose-limited aerobic conditions when analyzed with flux balance analysis. Additionally, Yeast 6 improves the accuracy of predicting the likelihood that a mutation will cause auxotrophy. The network reconstruction is available as a Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) file enriched with Minimium Information Requested in the Annotation of Biochemical Models (MIRIAM)-compliant annotations. Small- and macromolecules in the network are referenced to authoritative databases such as Uniprot or ChEBI. Molecules and reactions are also annotated with appropriate publications that contain supporting evidence. Yeast 6 is freely available at http://yeast.sf.net/ as three separate SBML files: a model using the SBML level 3 Flux Balance Constraint package, a model compatible with the MATLAB® COBRA Toolbox for backward compatibility and a reconstruction containing only reactions for which there is experimental evidence (without the non-biological reactions necessary for simulating growth).Database URL: http://yeast.sf.net/},

abstract = {Understanding cerebral energy metabolism in neurons and astrocytes is necessary for the interpretation of functional brain imaging data. It has been suggested that astrocytes can provide lactate as an energy fuel to neurons, a process referred to as astrocyte-neuron lactate shuttle (ANLS). Some authors challenged this hypothesis, defending the classical view that glucose is the major energy substrate of neurons, at rest as well as in response to a stimulation. To test the ANLS hypothesis from a theoretical point of view, we developed a mathematical model of compartmentalized energy metabolism between neurons and astrocytes, adopting hypotheses highly unfavorable to ANLS. Simulation results can be divided between two groups, depending on the relative neuron versus astrocyte stimulation. If this ratio is low, ANLS is observed during all the stimulus and poststimulus periods (continuous ANLS), but a high ratio induces ANLS only at the beginning of the stimulus and during the poststimulus period (triphasic behavior). Finally, our results show that current experimental data on lactate kinetics are compatible with the ANLS hypothesis, and that it is essential to assess the neuronal and astrocytic NADH/NAD+ ratio changes to test the ANLS hypothesis.},

abstract = {Metabolic interactions between multiple cell types are difficult to model using existing approaches. Here we present a workflow that integrates gene expression data, proteomics data and literature-based manual curation to model human metabolism within and between different types of cells. Transport reactions are used to account for the transfer of metabolites between models of different cell types via the interstitial fluid. We apply the method to create models of brain energy metabolism that recapitulate metabolic interactions between astrocytes and various neuron types relevant to Alzheimer's disease. Analysis of the models identifies genes and pathways that may explain observed experimental phenomena, including the differential effects of the disease on cell types and regions of the brain. Constraint-based modeling can thus contribute to the study and analysis of multicellular metabolic processes in the human tissue microenvironment and provide detailed mechanistic insight into high-throughput data analysis.},

Although technically and experimentally challenging, (13)C MRS has already provided important new information on the relationship between neuroenergetics and neuronal function, the energy cost of brain function, the high neuronal activity in the resting brain state and how neuroenergetics and neurotransmitter cycling are altered in neurological and psychiatric disease. In this article, the current state of (13)C MRS as it is applied to the study of neuroenergetics and neurotransmitter cycling in humans is reviewed. The focus is predominantly on recent findings in humans regarding metabolic pathways, applications to clinical research and the technical status of the method. Results from in vivo (13)C MRS studies in animals are discussed from the standpoint of the validation of MRS measurements of neuroenergetics and neurotransmitter cycling, and where they have helped to identify key questions to address in human research. Controversies concerning the relationship between neuroenergetics and neurotransmitter cycling and factors having an impact on the accurate determination of fluxes through mathematical modeling are addressed. We further touch upon different (13)C-labeled substrates used to study brain metabolism, before reviewing a number of human brain diseases investigated using (13)C MRS. Future technological developments are discussed that will help to overcome the limitations of (13)C MRS, with special attention given to recent developments in hyperpolarized (13)C MRS.},

abstract = {Inferring gene regulatory networks from high-throughput genomic data is one of the central problems in computational biology. In this paper, we describe a predictive modeling approach for studying regulatory networks, based on a machine learning algorithm called MEDUSA. MEDUSA integrates promoter sequence, mRNA expression, and transcription factor occupancy data to learn gene regulatory programs that predict the differential expression of target genes. Instead of using clustering or correlation of expression profiles to infer regulatory relationships, MEDUSA determines condition-specific regulators and discovers regulatory motifs that mediate the regulation of target genes. In this way, MEDUSA meaningfully models biological mechanisms of transcriptional regulation. MEDUSA solves the problem of predicting the differential (up/down) expression of target genes by using boosting, a technique from statistical learning, which helps to avoid overfitting as the algorithm searches through the high-dimensional space of potential regulators and sequence motifs. Experimental results demonstrate that MEDUSA achieves high prediction accuracy on held-out experiments (test data), that is, data not seen in training. We also present context-specific analysis of MEDUSA regulatory programs for DNA damage and hypoxia, demonstrating that MEDUSA identifies key regulators and motifs in these processes. A central challenge in the field is the difficulty of validating reverse-engineered networks in the absence of a gold standard. Our approach of learning regulatory programs provides at least a partial solution for the problem: MEDUSA's prediction accuracy on held-out data gives a concrete and statistically sound way to validate how well the algorithm performs. With MEDUSA, statistical validation becomes a prerequisite for hypothesis generation and network building rather than a secondary consideration.},

abstract = {A decline in brain function is a characteristic feature of healthy aging; however, little is known about the biologic basis of this phenomenon. To determine whether there are alterations in brain mitochondrial metabolism associated with healthy aging, we combined (13)C/(1)H magnetic resonance spectroscopy with infusions of [1-(13)C]glucose and [2-(13)C]acetate to quantitatively characterize rates of neuronal and astroglial tricarboxylic acid cycles, as well as neuroglial glutamate-glutamine cycling, in healthy elderly and young volunteers. Compared with young subjects, neuronal mitochondrial metabolism and glutamate-glutamine cycle flux was approximately 30\% lower in elderly subjects. The reduction in individual subjects correlated strongly with reductions in N-acetylaspartate and glutamate concentrations consistent with chronic reductions in brain mitochondrial function. In elderly subjects infused with [2-(13)C]acetate labeling of glutamine, C4 and C3 differed from that of the young subjects, indicating age-related changes in glial mitochondrial metabolism. Taken together, these studies show that healthy aging is associated with reduced neuronal mitochondrial metabolism and altered glial mitochondrial metabolism, which may in part be responsible for declines in brain function.},

abstract = {Skeletal muscle plays a major role in the regulation of whole-body energy metabolism during physiological stresses such as ischemia, hypoxia, and exercise. Current experimental techniques provide relatively little in vivo data on dynamic responses of metabolite concentrations and metabolic fluxes in skeletal muscle to such physiological stimuli. As a complementary approach to experimental measurements and as a framework for quantitatively analyzing available in vivo data, a physiologically based model of skeletal muscle cellular metabolism and energetics is developed. This model, which incorporates key transport and reaction processes, is based on dynamic mass balances of 30 chemical species in capillary (blood) and tissue (cell) domains. The reaction fluxes in the cellular domain are expressed in terms of a generalized Michaelis?Menten equation involving energy controller ratios ATP/ADP and ATP/ADP and NADH/NAD+ . This formalism introduces a large number of unknown parameters ( approximately 90). Estimating these parameters from in vivo sparse data and evaluating dynamic sensitivities of the model outputs with respect to these parameters is a challenging problem. Parameter estimation is accomplished using an efficient, nonlinear, constraint-based, optimization algorithm that minimizes differences between available experimental data and corresponding model outputs by explicitly utilizing equality constraints on resting fluxes and concentrations. With the estimated parameter values, the model is able to simulate dynamic responses to reduced blood flow (ischemia) of key metabolite concentrations and metabolic fluxes, both measured and nonmeasured. A general parameter sensitivity analysis is carried out to determine and characterize the parameters having the most and least effects on the measured outputs.},

abstract = {A well-established way of determining metabolic fluxes is to measure 2D [(13)C,(1)H] COSY NMR spectra of components of biomass grown on uniformly (13)C-labeled carbon sources. When using the entire set of measured data to simultaneously determine all fluxes in a proposed metabolic network model, the (13)C-labeling distribution in all measured compounds has to be simulated. This requires very large sets of isotopomer or cumomer balances. This article introduces the new concept of bondomers; entities that only vary in the numbers and positions of C-C bonds that have remained intact since the medium substrate molecule entered the metabolism. Bondomers are shown to have many analogies to isotopomers. One of these is that bondomers can be transformed to cumulative bondomers, just like isotopomers can be transformed to cumomers. Similarly to cumomers, cumulative bondomers allow an analytical solution of the entire set of balances describing a metabolic network. The main difference is that cumulative bondomer models are considerably smaller than corresponding cumomer models. This saves computational time, allows easier identifiability analysis, and yields new insights in the information content of 2D [(13)C,(1)H] COSY NMR data. We illustrate the theoretical concepts by means of a realistic example of the glycolytic and pentose phosphate pathways. The combinations of 2D [(13)C,(1)H] COSY NMR data that allow identification of all metabolic fluxes in these pathways are analyzed, and it is found that the NMR data contain less information than was previously expected.},

abstract = {The relationships between brain activity and accompanying hemodynamic and metabolic alterations, particularly between the cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen utilization (CMR(O2)) and cerebral blood flow (CBF), are not thoroughly established. CMR(O2) is closely coupled to the rate of tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle flux. In this study, the changes in glutamate labeling during (13)C labeled glucose administration were determined in the human brain as an index of alterations in neuronal TCA cycle turnover during increased neuronal activity. Two-volume (1)H-[(13)C] MR spectroscopy (MRS) of the visual cortex was combined with functional MRI (fMRI) at 4 Tesla. Hemifield visual stimulation was employed to obtain data simultaneously from activated and control regions located symmetrically in the two hemispheres of the brain. The results showed that the fractional change in the turnover rate of C4 carbon of glutamate was less than that of CBF during visual stimulation. The fractional changes in CMR(O2) (Delta CMR(O2)) induced by activation must be equal to or less than the fractional change in glutamate labeling kinetics. Therefore, the results impose an upper limit of approximately 30\% for Delta CMR(O2) and demonstrate: 1) that fractional CBF increases exceed Delta CMR(O2) during elevated activity in the visual cortex, and 2) that such an unequal change would explain the observed positive blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) effect in fMRI.

From template network-based methods to de novo reverse engineering from expression data, we discuss how regulatory networks can be reconstructed and integrated with metabolic models to improve model predictions and performance.

abstract = {The response of Escherichia coli central carbon metabolism to genetic and environmental manipulation has been studied by use of a recently developed methodology for metabolic flux ratio (METAFoR) analysis; this methodology can also directly reveal active metabolic pathways. Generation of fluxome data arrays by use of the METAFoR approach is based on two-dimensional (13)C-(1)H correlation nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy with fractionally labeled biomass and, in contrast to metabolic flux analysis, does not require measurements of extracellular substrate and metabolite concentrations. METAFoR analyses of E. coli strains that moderately overexpress phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase, pyruvate decarboxylase, or alcohol dehydrogenase revealed that only a few flux ratios change in concert with the overexpression of these enzymes. Disruption of both pyruvate kinase isoenzymes resulted in altered flux ratios for reactions connecting the phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) and pyruvate pools but did not significantly alter central metabolism. These data indicate remarkable robustness and rigidity in central carbon metabolism in the presence of genetic variation. More significant physiological changes and flux ratio differences were seen in response to altered environmental conditions. For example, in ammonia-limited chemostat cultures, compared to glucose-limited chemostat cultures, a reduced fraction of PEP molecules was derived through at least one transketolase reaction, and there was a higher relative contribution of anaplerotic PEP carboxylation than of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle for oxaloacetate synthesis. These two parameters also showed significant variation between aerobic and anaerobic batch cultures. Finally, two reactions catalyzed by PEP carboxykinase and malic enzyme were identified by METAFoR analysis; these had previously been considered absent in E. coli cells grown in glucose-containing media. Backward flux from the TCA cycle to glycolysis, as indicated by significant activity of PEP carboxykinase, was found only in glucose-limited chemostat culture, demonstrating that control of this futile cycle activity is relaxed under severe glucose limitation.},

abstract = {Reconstructions of cellular metabolism are publicly available for a variety of different microorganisms and some mammalian genomes. To date, these reconstructions are "genome-scale" and strive to include all reactions implied by the genome annotation, as well as those with direct experimental evidence. Clearly, many of the reactions in a genome-scale reconstruction will not be active under particular conditions or in a particular cell type. Methods to tailor these comprehensive genome-scale reconstructions into context-specific networks will aid predictive in silico modeling for a particular situation. We present a method called Gene Inactivity Moderated by Metabolism and Expression (GIMME) to achieve this goal. The GIMME algorithm uses quantitative gene expression data and one or more presupposed metabolic objectives to produce the context-specific reconstruction that is most consistent with the available data. Furthermore, the algorithm provides a quantitative inconsistency score indicating how consistent a set of gene expression data is with a particular metabolic objective. We show that this algorithm produces results consistent with biological experiments and intuition for adaptive evolution of bacteria, rational design of metabolic engineering strains, and human skeletal muscle cells. This work represents progress towards producing constraint-based models of metabolism that are specific to the conditions where the expression profiling data is available.},

@article{Poskar2012,
abstract = {BACKGROUND:Metabolic flux analysis has become an established method in systems biology and functional genomics. The most common approach for determining intracellular metabolic fluxes is to utilize mass spectrometry in combination with stable isotope labeling experiments. However, before the mass spectrometric data can be used it has to be corrected for biases caused by naturally occurring stable isotopes, by the analytical technique(s) employed, or by the biological sample itself. Finally the MS data and the labeling information it contains have to be assembled into a data format usable by flux analysis software (of which several dedicated packages exist). Currently the processing of mass spectrometric data is time-consuming and error-prone requiring peak by peak cut-and-paste analysis and manual curation. In order to facilitate high-throughput metabolic flux analysis, the automation of multiple steps in the analytical workflow is necessary.RESULTS:Here we describe iMS2Flux, software developed to automate, standardize and connect the data flow between mass spectrometric measurements and flux analysis programs. This tool streamlines the transfer of data from extraction via correction tools to 13C-Flux software by processing MS data from stable isotope labeling experiments. It allows the correction of large and heterogeneous MS datasets for the presence of naturally occurring stable isotopes, initial biomass and several mass spectrometry effects. Before and after data correction, several checks can be performed to ensure accurate data. The corrected data may be returned in a variety of formats including those used by metabolic flux analysis software such as 13CFLUX, OpenFLUX and 13CFLUX2.CONCLUSION:iMS2Flux is a versatile, easy to use tool for the automated processing of mass spectrometric data containing isotope labeling information. It represents the core framework for a standardized workflow and data processing. Due to its flexibility it facilitates the inclusion of different experimental datasets and thus can contribute to the expansion of flux analysis applications.},

abstract = {The partitioning of whole body carbon flux between fat and lean compartments affects body composition. We hypothesized that it is possible to simultaneously determine whole body carbon (energy) balance and the dynamics of lipids and proteins in specific tissues in vivo. Growing C57BL/6J mice fed a high-fat low-carbohydrate diet were injected with a bolus of "doubly labeled" water (i.e., (2)H2O and H2(18)O). The rate of CO2 production was determined from the difference between the elimination rates of 2H and 18O from body water. The rates of synthesis and degradation of triglycerides extracted from epididymal fat pads and of proteins extracted from heart muscle were determined by mathematically modeling the 2H labeling of triglyceride-bound glycerol and protein-bound alanine, respectively. We found that mice were in positive carbon balance (approximately 20\% retention per day) and accumulated lipid in epididymal fat pads (approximately 9 micromol triglyceride accumulated per day). This is consistent with the fact that mice were studied during a period of growth. Modeling the 2H labeling of triglycerides revealed a substantial rate of lipid breakdown during this anabolic state (equivalent to approximately 25\% of the newly synthesized triglyceride). We found equal rates of protein synthesis and breakdown in heart muscle (approximately 10\% of the pool per day), consistent with the fact that the heart muscle mass did not change. In total, these findings demonstrate a novel application of the doubly labeled water method. Utilization of this approach, especially in unique rodent models, should facilitate studies aimed at quantifying the efficacy of interventions that modulate whole body carbon balance and lipid flux while in parallel determining their impact on (cardiac) muscle protein turnover. Last, the simplicity of administering doubly labeled water and collecting samples allows this method to be used in virtually any laboratory setting.},

abstract = {As one of the most recent members of the omics family, large-scale quantitative metabolomics data are currently complementing our systems biology data pool and offer the chance to integrate the metabolite level into the functional analysis of cellular networks. Network-embedded thermodynamic analysis (NET analysis) is presented as a framework for mechanistic and model-based analysis of these data. By coupling the data to an operating metabolic network via the second law of thermodynamics and the metabolites' Gibbs energies of formation, NET analysis allows inferring functional principles from quantitative metabolite data; for example it identifies reactions that are subject to active allosteric or genetic regulation as exemplified with quantitative metabolite data from Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Moreover, the optimization framework of NET analysis was demonstrated to be a valuable tool to systematically investigate data sets for consistency, for the extension of sub-omic metabolome data sets and for resolving intracompartmental concentrations from cell-averaged metabolome data. Without requiring any kind of kinetic modeling, NET analysis represents a perfectly scalable and unbiased approach to uncover insights from quantitative metabolome data.},

abstract = {An integrative, systems approach to the modelling of brain energy metabolism is presented. Mechanisms such as glutamate cycling between neurons and astrocytes and glycogen storage in astrocytes have been implemented. A unique feature of the model is its calibration using in vivo data of brain glucose and lactate from freely moving rats under various stimuli. The model has been used to perform simulated perturbation experiments that show that glycogen breakdown in astrocytes is significantly activated during sensory (tail pinch) stimulation. This mechanism provides an additional input of energy substrate during high consumption phases. By way of validation, data from the perfusion of 50 microM propranolol in the rat brain was compared with the model outputs. Propranolol affects the glucose dynamics during stimulation, and this was accurately reproduced in the model by a reduction in the glycogen breakdown in astrocytes. The model's predictive capacity was verified by using data from a sensory stimulation (restraint) that was not used for model calibration. Finally, a sensitivity analysis was conducted on the model parameters, this showed that the control of energy metabolism and transport processes are critical in the metabolic behaviour of cerebral tissue.},

We have used a newly developed neuroimaging approach based on high-field in vivo (17)O magnetic resonance spectroscopic (MRS) imaging to noninvasively image cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO(2)) consumption in cats at rest and during visual stimulation. It was found that CMRO(2) increases significantly (32.3\%+/-10.8\%, n=6) in the activated visual cortical region as depicted in blood oxygenation level dependence functional maps; this increase is also accompanied by a CMRO(2) decrease in surrounding cortical regions, resulting a smaller increase (9.7\%+/-1.9\%) of total CMRO(2) change over a larger cortical region displaying either a positive or negative CMRO(2) alteration. Moreover, a negative correlation between stimulus-evoked percent CMRO(2) increase and resting CMRO(2) was observed, indicating an essential impact of resting brain metabolic activity level on stimulus-evoked percent CMRO(2) change and neuroimaging signals. These findings provide new insights into the critical roles of oxidative metabolism in supporting brain activation and function. They also suggest that in vivo (17)O MRS imaging should provide a sensitive neuroimaging modality for mapping CMRO(2) and its change induced by brain physiology and/or pathologic alteration.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Flux variability analysis (FVA) is an important tool to further analyse the results obtained by flux balance analysis (FBA) on genome-scale metabolic networks. For many constraint-based models, FVA identifies unboundedness of the optimal flux space. This reveals that optimal flux solutions with net flux through internal biochemical loops are feasible, which violates the second law of thermodynamics. Such unbounded fluxes may be eliminated by extending FVA with thermodynamic constraints. RESULTS: We present a new algorithm for efficient flux variability (and flux balance) analysis with thermodynamic constraints, suitable for analysing genome-scale metabolic networks. We first show that FBA with thermodynamic constraints is NP-hard. Then we derive a theoretical tractability result, which can be applied to metabolic networks in practice. We use this result to develop a new constraint programming algorithm Fast-tFVA for fast FVA with thermodynamic constraints (tFVA). Computational comparisons with previous methods demonstrate the efficiency of the new method. For tFVA, a speed-up of factor 30-300 is achieved. In an analysis of genome-scale metabolic networks in the BioModels database, we found that in 485 of 716 networks, additional irreversible or fixed reactions could be detected.Availability and implementation: Fast-tFVA is written in C++ and published under GPL. It uses the open source software SCIP and libSBML. There also exists a Matlab interface for easy integration into Matlab. Fast-tFVA is available from page.mi.fu-berlin.de/arnem/fast-tfva.html.

@article{Wu2008,
abstract = {To understand how cardiac ATP and CrP remain stable with changes in work rate - a phenomenon that has eluded mechanistic explanation for decades - data from (31)phosphate-magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((31)P-MRS) are analysed to estimate cytoplasmic and mitochondrial phosphate metabolite concentrations in the normal state, during high cardiac workstates, during acute ischaemia and reactive hyperaemic recovery. Analysis is based on simulating distributed heterogeneous oxygen transport in the myocardium integrated with a detailed model of cardiac energy metabolism. The model predicts that baseline myocardial free inorganic phosphate (P(i)) concentration in the canine myocyte cytoplasm - a variable not accessible to direct non-invasive measurement - is approximately 0.29 mm and increases to 2.3 mm near maximal cardiac oxygen consumption. During acute ischaemia (from ligation of the left anterior descending artery) P(i) increases to approximately 3.1 mm and ATP consumption in the ischaemic tissue is reduced quickly to less than half its baseline value before the creatine phosphate (CrP) pool is 18\% depleted. It is determined from these experiments that the maximal rate of oxygen consumption of the heart is an emergent property and is limited not simply by the maximal rate of ATP synthesis, but by the maximal rate at which ATP can be synthesized at a potential at which it can be utilized. The critical free energy of ATP hydrolysis for cardiac contraction that is consistent with these findings is approximately -63.5 kJ mol(-1). Based on theoretical findings, we hypothesize that inorganic phosphate is both the primary feedback signal for stimulating oxidative phosphorylation in vivo and also the most significant product of ATP hydrolysis in limiting the capacity of the heart to hydrolyse ATP in vivo. Due to the lack of precise quantification of P(i) in vivo, these hypotheses and associated model predictions remain to be carefully tested experimentally.},

abstract = {Metabolic modeling of dynamic (13)C labeling curves during infusion of (13)C-labeled substrates allows quantitative measurements of metabolic rates in vivo. However metabolic modeling studies performed in the brain to date have only modeled time courses of total isotopic enrichment at individual carbon positions (positional enrichments), not taking advantage of the additional dynamic (13)C isotopomer information available from fine-structure multiplets in (13)C spectra. Here we introduce a new (13)C metabolic modeling approach using the concept of bonded cumulative isotopomers, or bonded cumomers. The direct relationship between bonded cumomers and (13)C multiplets enables fitting of the dynamic multiplet data. The potential of this new approach is demonstrated using Monte-Carlo simulations with a brain two-compartment neuronal-glial model. The precision of positional and cumomer approaches are compared for two different metabolic models (with and without glutamine dilution) and for different infusion protocols ([1,6-(13)C(2)]glucose, [1,2-(13)C(2)]acetate, and double infusion [1,6-(13)C(2)]glucose + [1,2-(13)C(2)]acetate). In all cases, the bonded cumomer approach gives better precision than the positional approach. In addition, of the three different infusion protocols considered here, the double infusion protocol combined with dynamic bonded cumomer modeling appears the most robust for precise determination of all fluxes in the model. The concepts and simulations introduced in the present study set the foundation for taking full advantage of the available dynamic (13)C multiplet data in metabolic modeling.},

abstract = {The constraint-based reconstruction and analysis (COBRA) framework has been widely used to study steady-state flux solutions in genome-scale metabolic networks. One shortcoming of current COBRA methods is the possible violation of the loop law in the computed steady-state flux solutions. The loop law is analogous to Kirchhoff's second law for electric circuits, and states that at steady state there can be no net flux around a closed network cycle. Although the consequences of the loop law have been known for years, it has been computationally difficult to work with. Therefore, the resulting loop-law constraints have been overlooked. Here, we present a general mixed integer programming approach called loopless COBRA (ll-COBRA), which can be used to eliminate all steady-state flux solutions that are incompatible with the loop law. We apply this approach to improve flux predictions on three common COBRA methods: flux balance analysis, flux variability analysis, and Monte Carlo sampling of the flux space. Moreover, we demonstrate that the imposition of loop-law constraints with ll-COBRA improves the consistency of simulation results with experimental data. This method provides an additional constraint for many COBRA methods, enabling the acquisition of more realistic simulation results.},

abstract = {Analysis of metabolic networks using linear optimization theory allows one to quantify and understand the limitations imposed on the cell by its metabolic stoichiometry, and to understand how the flux through each pathway influences the overall behavior of metabolism. A stoichiometric matrix accounting for the major pathways involved in energy and mass transformations in the cell was used in our analysis. The auxiliary parameters of linear optimization, the so-called shadow prices, identify the intermediates and cofactors that cause the growth to be limited on each nutrient. This formalism was used to examine how well the cell balances its needs for carbon, nitrogen, and energy during growth on different substrates. The relative values of glucose and glutamine as nutrients were compared by varying the ratio of rates of glucose to glutamine uptakes, and calculating the maximum growth rate. The optimum value of this ratio is between 2-7, similar to experimentally observed ratios. The theoretical maximum growth rate was calculated for growth on each amino acid, and the amino acids catabolized directly to glutamate were found to be the optimal nutrients. The importance of each reaction in the network can be examined both by selectively limiting the flux through the reaction, and by the value of the reduced cost for that reaction. Some reactions, such as malic enzyme and glutamate dehydrogenase, may be inhibited or deleted with little or no adverse effect on the calculated cell growth rate.},

This reconstructed regulatory network coupled with an existing genome-scale metabolic network model allows in silico prediction of growth phenotypes of regulatory gene deletions as well as gene expression profiles. We compared model predictions of gene expression changes in response to genetic and environmental perturbations to experimental data to identify potential novel targets for transcription factors. We then identified regulatory cascades connecting transcription factors to the potential targets through a systematic model expansion strategy using published genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation and binding-site-motif data sets. Finally, we show the ability of an integrated metabolic and regulatory network model to predict growth phenotypes of transcription factor knockout strains. These studies illustrate the potential of model-driven data integration to systematically discover novel components and interactions in regulatory and metabolic networks in eukaryotic cells.},

abstract = {In this paper, we combined several mathematical models of cerebral metabolism and nutrient transport to investigate the energetic significance of metabolite trafficking within the brain parenchyma during a 360-secs activation. Glycolytic and oxidative cellular metabolism were homogeneously modeled between neurons and astrocytes, and the stimulation-induced neuronal versus astrocytic Na(+) inflow was set to 3:1. These assumptions resemble physiologic conditions and are supported by current literature. Simulations showed that glucose diffusion to the interstitium through basal lamina dominates the provision of the sugar to both neurons and astrocytes, whereas astrocytic endfeet transfer less than 4\% of the total glucose supplied to the tissue. Neuronal access to paracellularly diffused glucose prevails even after halving (doubling) the ratio of neuronal versus astrocytic glycolytic (oxidative) metabolism, as well as after reducing the neuronal versus astrocytic Na(+) inflow to a nonphysiologic value of 1:1. Noticeably, displaced glucose equivalents as intercellularly shuttled lactate account for approximately 6\% to 7\% of total brain glucose uptake, an amount comparable with the concomitant drainage of the monocarboxylate by the bloodstream. Overall, our results suggest that the control of carbon recruitment for neurons and astrocytes is exerted at the level of glucose uptake rather than that of lactate shuttle.},

abstract = {Fumarate hydratase (FH) is an enzyme of the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle) that catalyses the hydration of fumarate into malate. Germline mutations of FH are responsible for hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal-cell cancer (HLRCC). It has previously been demonstrated that the absence of FH leads to the accumulation of fumarate, which activates hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) at normal oxygen tensions. However, so far no mechanism that explains the ability of cells to survive without a functional TCA cycle has been provided. Here we use newly characterized genetically modified kidney mouse cells in which Fh1 has been deleted, and apply a newly developed computer model of the metabolism of these cells to predict and experimentally validate a linear metabolic pathway beginning with glutamine uptake and ending with bilirubin excretion from Fh1-deficient cells. This pathway, which involves the biosynthesis and degradation of haem, enables Fh1-deficient cells to use the accumulated TCA cycle metabolites and permits partial mitochondrial NADH production. We predicted and confirmed that targeting this pathway would render Fh1-deficient cells non-viable, while sparing wild-type Fh1-containing cells. This work goes beyond identifying a metabolic pathway that is induced in Fh1-deficient cells to demonstrate that inhibition of haem oxygenation is synthetically lethal when combined with Fh1 deficiency, providing a new potential target for treating HLRCC patients.},

abstract = {Motivation: Genome-scale metabolic models have been used extensively to investigate alterations in cellular metabolism. The accuracy of these models to represent cellular metabolism in specific conditions has been improved by constraining the model with omics data sources. However, few practical methods for integrating metabolomics data with other omics data sources into genome-scale models of metabolism have been developed.Results: GIM3E (Gene Inactivation Moderated by Metabolism, Metabolomics and Expression) is an algorithm that enables the development of condition-specific models based on an objective function, transcriptomics and cellular metabolomics data. GIM3E establishes metabolite use requirements with metabolomics data, uses model-paired transcriptomics data to find experimentally supported solutions and provides calculations of the turnover (production/consumption) flux of metabolites. GIM3E was used to investigate the effects of integrating additional omics datasets to create increasingly constrained solution spaces of Salmonella Typhimurium metabolism during growth in both rich and virulence media. This integration proved to be informative and resulted in a requirement of additional active reactions (12 in each case) or metabolites (26 or 29, respectively). The addition of constraints from transcriptomics also impacted the allowed solution space, and the cellular metabolites with turnover fluxes that were necessarily altered by the change in conditions increased from 118 to 271 of 1397.Availability: GIM3E has been implemented in Python and requires a COBRApy 0.2.x.

However, the reliability of such two-compartment metabolic modeling has not been examined thoroughly. This study uses Monte-Carlo simulations to investigate the reliability of metabolic modeling of (13)C positional enrichment time courses measured in brain amino acids such as glutamate and glutamine during 1-(13)C- or 1,6-(13)C(2)glucose infusion. Results show that the determination of V(NT) is not very precise under experimental conditions typical of in vivo NMR studies, whereas the neuronal TCA cycle rate V(TCA(N)) is determined with a much higher precision. Consistent with these results, simulated (13)C positional enrichment curves for glutamate and glutamine are much more sensitive to the value of V(TCA(N)) than to the value of V(NT). We conclude that the determination of the glutamate-glutamine cycle rate V(NT) using (13)C MRS is relatively unreliable when fitting (13)C positional enrichment curves obtained during 1-(13)C or 1,6-(13)C(2)glucose infusion. Further developments are needed to improve the determination of V(NT), for example using additional information from (13)C-(13)C isotopomers and/or using glial specific substrates such as 2-(13)Cacetate.},

abstract = {Control mechanisms of cellular metabolism and energetics in skeletal muscle that may become evident in response to physiological stresses such as reduction in blood flow and oxygen supply to mitochondria can be quantitatively understood using a multi-scale computational model. The analysis of dynamic responses from such a model can provide insights into mechanisms of metabolic regulation that may not be evident from experimental studies. For the purpose, a physiologically-based, multi-scale computational model of skeletal muscle cellular metabolism and energetics was developed to describe dynamic responses of key chemical species and reaction fluxes to muscle ischemia. The model, which incorporates key transport and metabolic processes and subcellular compartmentalization, is based on dynamic mass balances of 30 chemical species in both capillary blood and tissue cells (cytosol and mitochondria) domains. The reaction fluxes in cytosol and mitochondria are expressed in terms of a general phenomenological Michaelis-Menten equation involving the compartmentalized energy controller ratios ATP/ADP and NADH/NAD(+). The unknown transport and reaction parameters in the model are estimated simultaneously by minimizing the differences between available in vivo experimental data on muscle ischemia and corresponding model outputs in coupled with the resting linear flux balance constraints using a robust, nonlinear, constrained-based, reduced gradient optimization algorithm. With the optimal parameter values, the model is able to simulate dynamic responses to reduced blood flow and oxygen supply to mitochondria associated with muscle ischemia of several key metabolite concentrations and metabolic fluxes in the subcellular cytosolic and mitochondrial compartments, some that can be measured and others that can not be measured with the current experimental techniques. The model can be applied to test complex hypotheses involving dynamic regulation of cellular metabolism and energetics in skeletal muscle during physiological stresses such as ischemia, hypoxia, and exercise.},

abstract = {The rapid progress of molecular biology tools for directed genetic modifications, accurate quantitative experimental approaches, high-throughput measurements, together with development of genome sequencing has made the foundation for a new area of metabolic engineering that is driven by metabolic models. Systematic analysis of biological processes by means of modelling and simulations has made the identification of metabolic networks and prediction of metabolic capabilities under different conditions possible. For facilitating such systemic analysis, we have developed the BioMet Toolbox, a web-based resource for stoichiometric analysis and for integration of transcriptome and interactome data, thereby exploiting the capabilities of genome-scale metabolic models. The BioMet Toolbox provides an effective user-friendly way to perform linear programming simulations towards maximized or minimized growth rates, substrate uptake rates and metabolic production rates by detecting relevant fluxes, simulate single and double gene deletions or detect metabolites around which major transcriptional changes are concentrated.

abstract = {In response to exercise, the heart increases its metabolic rate severalfold while maintaining energy species (e.g., ATP, ADP, and Pi) concentrations constant; however, the mechanisms that regulate this response are unclear. Limited experimental studies show that the classic regulatory species NADH and NAD+ are also maintained nearly constant with increased cardiac power generation, but current measurements lump the cytosol and mitochondria and do not provide dynamic information during the early phase of the transition from low to high work states. In the present study, we modified our previously published computational model of cardiac metabolism by incorporating parallel activation of ATP hydrolysis, glycolysis, mitochondrial dehydrogenases, the electron transport chain, and oxidative phosphorylation, and simulated the metabolic responses of the heart to an abrupt increase in energy expenditure. Model simulations showed that myocardial oxygen consumption, pyruvate oxidation, fatty acids oxidation, and ATP generation were all increased with increased energy expenditure, whereas ATP and ADP remained constant. Both cytosolic and mitochondrial NADH/NAD+ increased during the first minutes (by 40\% and 20\%, respectively) and returned to the resting values by 10-15 min. Furthermore, model simulations showed that an altered substrate selection, induced by either elevated arterial lactate or diabetic conditions, affected cytosolic NADH/NAD+ but had minimal effects on the mitochondrial NADH/NAD+, myocardial oxygen consumption, or ATP production. In conclusion, these results support the concept of parallel activation of metabolic processes generating reducing equivalents during an abrupt increase in cardiac energy expenditure and suggest there is a transient increase in the mitochondrial NADH/NAD+ ratio that is independent of substrate supply.},

abstract = {Mitochondria in excitable cells are recurrently exposed to pulsatile calcium gradients that activate cell function. Rapid calcium uptake by the mitochondria has previously been shown to cause uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation. To test (i) if periodic nerve firing may cause oscillation of the cytosolic thermodynamic potential of ATP hydrolysis and (ii) if cytosolic adenylate (AK) and creatine kinase (CK) ATP buffering reactions dampen such oscillations, a lumped kinetic model of an excitable cell capturing major aspects of the physiology has been developed. Activation of ATP metabolism by low-frequency calcium pulses caused large oscillation of the cytosolic, but not mitochondrial ATP/ADP, ratio. This outcome was independent of net ATP synthesis or hydrolysis during mitochondrial calcium uptake. The AK/CK ATP buffering reactions dampened the amplitude and rate of cytosolic ATP/ADP changes on a timescale of seconds, but not milliseconds. These model predictions suggest that alternative sources of capacitance in neurons and striated muscles should be considered to protect ATP-free energy-driven cell functions.},

We present noninvasive hyperpolarized (13)C NMR investigations on the metabolic flux of pyruvate to lactate, in a well-controlled injection/perfusion system using T47D human breast cancer cells. Initial rates of pyruvate-to-lactate conversion were obtained by fitting the hyperpolarized (13)C and ancillary (31)P NMR data to a model, yielding both kinetic parameters and mechanistic insight into this conversion. Transport was found to be the rate-limiting process for the conversion of extracellular pyruvate to lactate with K(m) = 2.14 +/- 0.03 mM, typical of the monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1), and a V(max) = 27.6 +/- 1.1 fmolxmin(-1).cell(-1), in agreement with the high expression level of this transporter. Modulation of the environment to hypoxic conditions as well as suppression of cells' perfusion enhanced the rate of pyruvate-to-lactate conversion, presumably by up-regulation of the MCT1. Conversely, the addition of quercetin, a flavonoidal MCT1 inhibitor, markedly reduces the apparent rate of pyruvate-to-lactate conversion. These results suggest that hyperpolarized (13)C(1)-pyruvate may be a useful magnetic resonance biomarker of MCT regulation and malignant transformations in breast cancer.},

The inherent complexities of energy and mitochondrial metabolism present a significant obstacle in the effort to understand the role that these molecular processes play in the development of disease. To help unravel these complexities, systems biology methods have been applied to develop an array of computational metabolic models, ranging from mitochondria-specific processes to genome-scale cellular networks. These constraint-based (CB) models can efficiently simulate aspects of normal and aberrant metabolism in various genetic and environmental conditions. Development of these models leverages-and also provides a powerful means to integrate and interpret-information from a wide range of sources including genomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and enzyme kinetics. Here, we review a variety of mechanistic modeling studies that explore metabolic functions, deficiency disorders, and aberrant biochemical pathways in mitochondria and related regions in the cell.},

The resulting eight time courses were simultaneously fitted to a mathematical model. The rate of (neuronal) tricarboxylic acid cycle flux (V(PDH)), 0.57 +/- 0.06 micromol. g(-1). min(-1), was comparable to the exchange rate between (mitochondrial) 2-oxoglutarate and (cytosolic) glutamate (Vx), 0.57 +/- 0.19 micromol. g(-1). min(-1)), which may reflect to a large extent malate-aspartate shuttle activity. At rest, oxidative glucose consumption [CMR(Glc(ox))] was 0.41 +/- 0.03 miccromol. g(-1). min(-1), and (glial) pyruvate carboxylation (VPC) was 0.09 +/- 0.02 micromol. g(-1). min(-1). The flux through glutamine synthetase (Vsyn) was 0.26 +/- 0.06 micromol. g(-1). min(-1). A fraction of Vsyn was attributed to be from (neuronal) glutamate, and the corresponding rate of apparent glutamatergic neurotransmission (VNT) was 0.17 +/- 0.05 micromol. g(-1). min(-1). The ratio [VNT/CMR(Glcox)] was 0.41 +/- 0.14 and thus clearly different from a 1:1 stoichiometry, consistent with a significant fraction (approximately 90\%) of ATP generated in astrocytes being oxidative. The study underlines the importance of assumptions made in modeling 13C labeling data in brain.},

abstract = {The cause of Parkinson's disease (PD) remains unknown despite it being the second most prevalent neurodegenerative condition. Indeed, there is a growing consensus that there is no single cause, and that PD is a multifactorial systemic condition, in which a number of factors may determine its etiopathogenesis. We describe a systems approach that addresses the multifactorial aspects of PD and overcomes constraints on conventional experimentation imposed by PD's causal complexity, its long temporal duration, and its uniqueness to human brains. Specifically, a mathematical model of brain energy metabolism is used as a core module to which other modules describing cellular processes thought to be associated with PD can be attached and studied in an integrative environment. Employing brain energy usage as the core of a systems approach also enables the potential role that compromised energy metabolism may have in the etiology of PD. Although developed for PD, it has not escaped our attention that the energy systems approach outlined here could also be applied to other neurodegenerative disorders-most notably Alzheimer's disease.},

(1987) FEBS Lett. 212, 58-62) for measuring the relative flux of molecules through the oxidative versus anaplerotic pathways involving the citric acid cycle of the rat heart has been extended to include a complete analysis of the entire glutamate 13C spectrum. Although still simple in practice, this more sophisticated model allows an evaluation of 13C fractional enrichment of molecules entering both the oxidative and anaplerotic pathways under steady-state conditions. The method was used to analyze 13C NMR spectra of intact hearts or their acid extracts during utilization of 13C-enriched pyruvate, propionate, acetate, or various combinations thereof. [2-13C]Pyruvate was used to prove that steady-state flux of pyruvate through pyruvate carboxylase is significant during co-perfusion of pyruvate and acetate, and we demonstrate for the first time that a nine-line 13C multiplet may be detected in an intact, beating heart. Acetate or pyruvate alone provided about 86\% of the acetyl-CoA; in combination, about 65\% of the acetyl-CoA was derived from acetate, about 30\% was derived from pyruvate, and the remainder from endogenous sources. Propionate reduced the contribution of exogenous acetate to acetyl-CoA to 77\% and also reduced the oxidation of endogenous substrates. Equations are presented which allow this same analysis on multiply labeled substrates, making this technique extremely powerful for the evaluation of substrate selection and relative metabolic flux through anaplerotic and oxidative pathways in the intact heart.},

abstract = {Metabolic flux analysis (MFA) has emerged as a tool of great significance for metabolic engineering and mammalian physiology. An important limitation of MFA, as carried out via stable isotope labeling and GC/MS and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements, is the large number of isotopomer or cumomer equations that need to be solved, especially when multiple isotopic tracers are used for the labeling of the system. This restriction reduces the ability of MFA to fully utilize the power of multiple isotopic tracers in elucidating the physiology of realistic situations comprising complex bioreaction networks. Here, we present a novel framework for the modeling of isotopic labeling systems that significantly reduces the number of system variables without any loss of information. The elementary metabolite unit (EMU) framework is based on a highly efficient decomposition method that identifies the minimum amount of information needed to simulate isotopic labeling within a reaction network using the knowledge of atomic transitions occurring in the network reactions. The functional units generated by the decomposition algorithm, called EMUs, form the new basis for generating system equations that describe the relationship between fluxes and stable isotope measurements. Isotopomer abundances simulated using the EMU framework are identical to those obtained using the isotopomer and cumomer methods, however, require significantly less computation time. For a typical (13)C-labeling system the total number of equations that needs to be solved is reduced by one order-of-magnitude (100s EMUs vs. 1000s isotopomers). As such, the EMU framework is most efficient for the analysis of labeling by multiple isotopic tracers. For example, analysis of the gluconeogenesis pathway with (2)H, (13)C, and (18)O tracers requires only 354 EMUs, compared to more than two million isotopomers.},

abstract = {This work concerns the cause of glycolytic oscillations in yeast. We analyse experimental data as well as models in two distinct cases: the relaxation-like oscillations seen in yeast extracts, and the sinusoidal Hopf oscillations seen in intact yeast cells. In the case of yeast extracts, we use flux-change plots and model analyses to establish that the oscillations are driven by on/off switching of phosphofructokinase. In the case of intact yeast cells, we find that the instability leading to the appearance of oscillations is caused by the stoichiometry of the ATP-ADP-AMP system and the allosteric regulation of phosphofructokinase, whereas frequency control is distributed over the reaction network. Notably, the NAD+/NADH ratio modulates the frequency of the oscillations without affecting the instability. This is important for understanding the mutual synchronization of oscillations in the individual yeast cells, as synchronization is believed to occur via acetaldehyde, which in turn affects the frequency of oscillations by changing this ratio.},

abstract = {The integration of various types of genomic data into predictive models of biological networks is one of the main challenges currently faced by computational biology. Constraint-based models in particular play a key role in the attempt to obtain a quantitative understanding of cellular metabolism at genome scale. In essence, their goal is to frame the metabolic capabilities of an organism based on minimal assumptions that describe the steady states of the underlying reaction network via suitable stoichiometric constraints, specifically mass balance and energy balance (i.e. thermodynamic feasibility). The implementation of these requirements to generate viable configurations of reaction fluxes and/or to test given flux profiles for thermodynamic feasibility can however prove to be computationally intensive. We propose here a fast and scalable stoichiometry-based method to explore the Gibbs energy landscape of a biochemical network at steady state. The method is applied to the problem of reconstructing the Gibbs energy landscape underlying metabolic activity in the human red blood cell, and to that of identifying and removing thermodynamically infeasible reaction cycles in the Escherichia coli metabolic network (iAF1260). In the former case, we produce consistent predictions for chemical potentials (or log-concentrations) of intracellular metabolites; in the latter, we identify a restricted set of loops (23 in total) in the periplasmic and cytoplasmic core as the origin of thermodynamic infeasibility in a large sample (10(6)) of flux configurations generated randomly and compatibly with the prior information available on reaction reversibility.},

abstract = {The low sensitivity of 13C spectroscopy can be enhanced using dynamic nuclear polarization. Detection of hyperpolarized 1-(13)Cpyruvate and its metabolic products has been reported in kidney, liver, and muscle. In this work, the feasibility of measuring 13C signals of hyperpolarized 13C metabolic products in the rat brain in vivo following the injection of hyperpolarized 1-(13)Cpyruvate and 2-(13)Cpyruvate is investigated. Injection of 2-(13)Cpyruvate led to the detection of 2-(13)Clactate, but no other downstream metabolites such as TCA cycle intermediates were detected. Injection of 1-(13)Cpyruvate enabled the detection of both 1-(13)Clactate and 13Cbicarbonate. A metabolic model was used to fit the hyperpolarized 13C time courses obtained during infusion of 1-(13)Cpyruvate and to determine the values of VPDH and VLDH.},

abstract = {The last few years have brought tremendous progress in experimental methods for metabolic flux determination by carbon-labeling experiments. A significant enlargement of the available measurement data set has been achieved, especially when isotopomer fractions within intracellular metabolite pools are quantitated. This information can be used to improve the statistical quality of flux estimates. Furthermore, several assumptions on bidirectional intracellular reaction steps that were hitherto indispensable may now become obsolete. To make full use of the complete measurement information a general mathematical model for isotopomer systems is established in this contribution. Then, by introducing the important new concept of cumomers and cumomer fractions, it is shown that the arising nonlinear isotopomer balance equations can be solved analytically in all cases. In particular, the solution of the metabolite flux balances and the positional carbon-labeling balances presented in part I of this series turn out to be just the first two steps of the general solution procedure for isotopomer balances. A detailed analysis of the isotopomer network structure then opens up new insights into the intrinsic structure of isotopomer systems. In particular, it turns out that isotopomer systems are not as complex as they appear at first glance. This enables some far-reaching conclusions to be drawn on the information potential of isotopomer experiments with respect to flux identification. Finally, some illustrative examples are examined to show that an information increase is not guaranteed when isotopomer measurements are used in addition to positional enrichment data.},

Computational genome-scale metabolic models have shown utility in integrating -omic as well as physiologic data for systemic, mechanistic analysis of metabolism. To date, integrative analysis of host-pathogen interactions using in silico mass-balanced, genome-scale models has not been performed. We, therefore, constructed a cell-specific alveolar macrophage model, iAB-AM\O-1410, from the global human metabolic reconstruction, Recon 1. The model successfully predicted experimentally verified ATP and nitric oxide production rates in macrophages. This model was then integrated with an M. tuberculosis H37Rv model, iNJ661, to build an integrated host-pathogen genome-scale reconstruction, iAB-AM\O-1410-Mt-661. The integrated host-pathogen network enables simulation of the metabolic changes during infection. The resulting reaction activity and gene essentiality targets of the integrated model represent an altered infectious state. High-throughput data from infected macrophages were mapped onto the host-pathogen network and were able to describe three distinct pathological states. Integrated host-pathogen reconstructions thus form a foundation upon which understanding the biology and pathophysiology of infections can be developed.},

abstract = {The extension of metabolite balancing with carbon labeling experiments, as described by Marx et al. (Biotechnol. Bioeng. 49: 11-29), results in a much more detailed stationary metabolic flux analysis. As opposed to basic metabolite flux balancing alone, this method enables both flux directions of bidirectional reaction steps to be quantitated. However, the mathematical treatment of carbon labeling systems is much more complicated, because it requires the solution of numerous balance equations that are bilinear with respect to fluxes and fractional labeling. In this study, a universal modeling framework is presented for describing the metabolite and carbon atom flux in a metabolic network. Bidirectional reaction steps are extensively treated and their impact on the system's labeling state is investigated. Various kinds of modeling assumptions, as usually made for metabolic fluxes, are expressed by linear constraint equations. A numerical algorithm for the solution of the resulting linear constrained set of nonlinear equations is developed. The numerical stability problems caused by large bidirectional fluxes are solved by a specially developed transformation method. Finally, the simulation of carbon labeling experiments is facilitated by a flexible software tool for network synthesis. An illustrative simulation study on flux identifiability from available flux and labeling measurements in the cyclic pentose phosphate pathway of a recombinant strain of Zymomonas mobilis concludes this contribution.},

Spectra were acquired every 98 s during a 60-min infusion of [1-13C]glucose. Complete time courses were obtained from six animals. The measured intensity of the unresolved [4-13CH2] resonances of glutamate and glutamine increased exponentially during the infusion and attained a steady state in approximately 20 min with a first-order rate constant of 0.130 +/- 0.010 min-1 (t1/2 = 5.3 +/- 0.5 min). The appearance of the [3-13CH2] resonance in the POCE difference spectrum lagged behind that of the [4-13CH2] resonance and had not reached steady state at the end of the 60-min infusion (t1/2 = 26.6 +/- 4.1 min). The increase observed in 13C-labeled glutamate represented isotopic enrichment and was not due to a change in the total glutamate concentration. The glucose infusion did not affect the levels of high-energy phosphates or intracellular pH as determined by 31P NMR spectroscopy. Since glucose carbon is incorporated into glutamate by rapid exchange with the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediate alpha-ketoglutarate, the rate of glutamate labeling provided an estimate of TCA cycle flux. We have determined the flux of carbon through the TCA cycle to be approximately 1.4 mumols g-1 min-1. These experiments demonstrate the feasibility of measuring metabolic fluxes in vivo using 13C-labeled glucose and the technique of 1H-observed, 13C-decoupled NMR spectroscopy.},

However, because high concentration of free intracellular iron is cytotoxic, cells have developed complex regulatory networks that keep free intracellular iron concentration at optimal range, allowing the incorporation of the metal into iron-using enzymes and minimizing damage to the cell. We built a mathematical model of the network that controls iron uptake and usage in the bacterium Escherichia coli to explore the dynamics of iron flow. We simulate the effect of sudden decrease or increase in the extracellular iron level on intracellular iron distribution. Based on the results of simulations we discuss the possible roles of the small RNA RyhB and the Fe-S cluster assembly systems in the optimal redistribution of iron flows. We suggest that Fe-S cluster assembly is crucial to prevent the accumulation of toxic levels of free intracellular iron when the environment suddenly becomes iron rich.},

In this approach, the underdetermined system of metabolite balances deduced from stoichiometric relations and measured extracellular rates is complemented with 13C constraints from metabolic flux ratio analysis. Fluxes in central carbon metabolism of exponentially growing Escherichia coli were estimated by 13C-constrained flux balancing from three different 13C-labeled glucose experiments. The best resolution of the network was achieved using 13C constraints derived from [U-13C]glucose and [1-13C]glucose experiments. The corresponding flux estimate was in excellent agreement with a solution that was independently obtained with a comprehensive isotopomer model. This new methodology was also demonstrated to faithfully capture the intracellular flux distribution in E. coli shake flasks and 1-ml deep-well microtiter plates. Due to its simplicity, speed, and robustness, 13C-constrained metabolic flux balancing is promising for routine and high-throughput analysis on a miniaturized scale.},

The hearts were frozen different times after addition of 13C-substrate and neutralized perchloric acid extracts from three pooled hearts per time point were used to obtain high resolution proton-decoupled 13C NMR spectra at 90.55 MHz. The 13C fractional enrichment of individual carbons of different metabolites was calculated from the area of the resolved resonances after correction for nuclear Overhauser enhancement and saturation effects. A mathematical flux model of the citric acid cycle and ancillary transamination reactions was constructed with the FACSIMILE program, and used to solve unknown flux parameters with constant pool sizes by nonlinear least squares analysis of the approximately 200 simultaneous differential equations required to describe the reactions. With [2-13C] acetate as substrate, resonances and line splittings due to 13C-13C spin coupling of the C-2, C-3, and C-4 carbons of glutamate were well resolved. The half-times to reach maximum 13C enrichment were 2.6 min for glutamate C-4 and 8 min for glutamate C-2 and C-3. From these data, a well determined citric acid cycle flux of 8.3 mumol/g dry weight X min was calculated for an observed oxygen consumption of 31 mumol/g dry weight X min. With [3-13C]pyruvate as substrate, resonances of aspartate C-2 and C-3 and of alanine C-3 were well resolved in addition to those of glutamate C-2, C-3, and C-4. Nonlinear least squares fitting of these data to the model gave nonrandomly distributed residuals for the 13C fractional enrichments of glutamate C-4, suggesting an incomplete model, but a well determined cycle flux of 11.9 mumol/g dry weight X min for an oxygen uptake of 35 mumol/g dry weight X min. Our studies demonstrate the practicality of 13C NMR, used in conjunction with mathematical modeling, for the measurement of metabolic flux parameters in living systems.},

abstract = {In the last few years metabolic flux analysis (MFA) using carbon labeling experiments (CLE) has become a major diagnostic tool in metabolic engineering. The mathematical centerpiece of MFA is the solution of isotopomer labeling systems (ILS). An ILS is a high-dimensional nonlinear differential equation system that describes the distribution of isotopomers over a metabolic network during a carbon labeling experiment. This contribution presents a global analysis of the dynamic behavior of general ILSs. It is proven that an ILS is globally stable under very weak conditions that are always satisfied in practice. In particular it is shown that in some sense ILSs are a nonlinear extension to the classical theory of compartmental systems. The central stability condition for compartmental systems, i.e., the non-existence of traps in linear compartmental networks, is also the major stability condition for ILSs. As an important side result of the proof, it is shown that ILSs can be transformed to a cascade of linear systems with time-dependent inhomogeneous terms. This cascade structure has considerable consequences for the development of efficient numerical algorithms for the solution of ILSs and thus for MFA.},

abstract = {The Krebs cycle plays a fundamental role in cardiac energy production and is often implicated in the energetic imbalance characteristic of heart disease. In this study, we measured Krebs cycle flux in real time in perfused rat hearts using hyperpolarized magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). [2-(13)C]Pyruvate was hyperpolarized and infused into isolated perfused hearts in both healthy and postischemic metabolic states. We followed the enzymatic conversion of pyruvate to lactate, acetylcarnitine, citrate, and glutamate with 1 s temporal resolution. The appearance of (13)C-labeled glutamate was delayed compared with that of other metabolites, indicating that Krebs cycle flux can be measured directly. The production of (13)C-labeled citrate and glutamate was decreased postischemia, as opposed to lactate, which was significantly elevated. These results showed that the control and fluxes of the Krebs cycle in heart disease can be studied using hyperpolarized [2-(13)C]pyruvate.},

abstract = {A mathematical model of cerebral glucose metabolism was developed to analyze the isotopic labeling of carbon atoms C4 and C3 of glutamate following an intravenous infusion of [1-13C]glucose. The model consists of a series of coupled metabolic pools representing glucose, glycolytic intermediates, tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediates, glutamate, aspartate, and glutamine. Based on the rate of 13C isotopic labeling of glutamate C4 measured in a previous study, the TCA cycle rate in rat brain was determined to be 1.58 +/- 0.41 mumol min-1 g-1 (mean +/- SD, n = 5). Analysis of the difference between the rates of isotopic enrichment of glutamate C4 and C3 permitted the rate of exchange between alpha-ketoglutarate (alpha-KG) and glutamate to be assessed in vivo. In rat brain, the exchange rate between alpha-KG and glutamate is between 89 +/- 35 and 126 +/- 22 times faster than the TCA cycle rate (mean +/- SD, n = 4). The sensitivity of the calculated value of the TCA cycle rate to other metabolic fluxes and to concentrations of glycolytic and TCA cycle intermediates was tested and found to be small.},

(2)H substitution of the lactate H2 hydrogen resulted in two easily detectable transformations of the vicinal H3 doublet resonance: 1) the formation of an H3 singlet due to the disappearance of the homonuclear coupling to H2 ((3)J(betaH-alphaH) = 7.0 Hz), and 2) an upfield isotopic shift derived from the vicinal (2)H2 substitution (Delta(3) = -0.007 ppm). Only those lactate molecules that have passed through the cell cytosol experience these effects, since H2 deuteration involves lactate dehydrogenase activity and NAD((2)H). Thus, analysis of the observed shifted and unshifted H3 lactate resonances from the incubation medium allows the discrimination of the perprotonated (3-(13)C) lactate added as substrate, and the (3-(13)C, 2-(2)H) lactate recycled to the incubation medium after passage through the cytosol.},

abstract = {Advances in the field of bioinformatics have led to reconstruction of genome-scale networks for a number of key organisms. The application of physicochemical constraints to these stoichiometric networks allows researchers, through methods such as flux balance analysis, to highlight key sets of reactions necessary to achieve particular objectives. The key benefits of constraint-based analysis lie in the minimal knowledge required to infer systemic properties. However, network degeneracy leads to a large number of flux distributions that satisfy any objective; moreover, these distributions may be dominated by biologically irrelevant internal cycles. By examining the geometry underlying the problem, we define two methods for finding a unique solution within the space of all possible flux distributions; such a solution contains no internal cycles, and is representative of the space as a whole. The first method draws on typical geometric knowledge, but cannot be applied to large networks because of the high computational complexity of the problem. Thus a second method, an iteration of linear programs which scales easily to the genome scale, is defined. The algorithm is run on four recent genome-scale models, and unique flux solutions are found. The algorithm set out here will allow researchers in flux balance analysis to exchange typical solutions to their models in a reproducible format. Moreover, having found a single solution, statistical analyses such as correlations may be performed.},

abstract = {Flux balance models of metabolism use stoichiometry of metabolic pathways, metabolic demands of growth, and optimality principles to predict metabolic flux distribution and cellular growth under specified environmental conditions. These models have provided a mechanistic interpretation of systemic metabolic physiology, and they are also useful as a quantitative tool for metabolic pathway design. Quantitative predictions of cell growth and metabolic by-product secretion that are experimentally testable can be obtained from these models. In the present report, we used independent measurements to determine the model parameters for the wild-type Escherichia coli strain W3110. We experimentally determined the maximum oxygen utilization rate (15 mmol of O2 per g [dry weight] per h), the maximum aerobic glucose utilization rate (10.5 mmol of Glc per g [dry weight] per h), the maximum anaerobic glucose utilization rate (18.5 mmol of Glc per g [dry weight] per h), the non-growth-associated maintenance requirements (7.6 mmol of ATP per g [dry weight] per h), and the growth-associated maintenance requirements (13 mmol of ATP per g of biomass). The flux balance model specified by these parameters was found to quantitatively predict glucose and oxygen uptake rates as well as acetate secretion rates observed in chemostat experiments. We have formulated a predictive algorithm in order to apply the flux balance model to describe unsteady-state growth and by-product secretion in aerobic batch, fed-batch, and anaerobic batch cultures. In aerobic experiments we observed acetate secretion, accumulation in the culture medium, and reutilization from the culture medium. In fed-batch cultures acetate is cometabolized with glucose during the later part of the culture period.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

Glucose and glutamine, in particular, are the primary carbon sources for proliferating cancer cells. While this combination of substrates generates static labeling patterns for use in (13)C metabolic flux analysis (MFA), the inability of single tracers to effectively label all pathways poses an obstacle for comprehensive flux determination within a given experiment. To address this issue we applied a genetic algorithm to optimize mixtures of (13)C-labeled glucose and glutamine for use in MFA. We identified tracer combinations that minimized confidence intervals in an experimentally determined flux network describing central carbon metabolism in tumor cells. Additional simulations were used to determine the robustness of the [1,2-(13)C(2)]glucose/[U-(13)C(5)]glutamine tracer combination with respect to perturbations in the network. Finally, we experimentally validated the improved performance of this tracer set relative to glucose tracers alone in a cancer cell line. This versatile method allows researchers to determine the optimal tracer combination to use for a specific metabolic network, and our findings applied to cancer cells significantly enhance the ability of MFA experiments to precisely quantify fluxes in higher organisms.},

The most recent release of HMDB (version 2.0) has been significantly expanded and enhanced over the previous release (version 1.0). In particular, the number of fully annotated metabolite entries has grown from 2180 to more than 6800 (a 300\% increase), while the number of metabolites with biofluid or tissue concentration data has grown by a factor of five (from 883 to 4413). Similarly, the number of purified compounds with reference to NMR, LC-MS and GC-MS spectra has more than doubled (from 380 to more than 790 compounds). In addition to this significant expansion in database size, many new database searching tools and new data content has been added or enhanced. These include better algorithms for spectral searching and matching, more powerful chemical substructure searches, faster text searching software, as well as dedicated pathway searching tools and customized, clickable metabolic maps. Changes to the user-interface have also been implemented to accommodate future expansion and to make database navigation much easier.

This ATP production rate plays central roles in brain bioenergetics, function and neurodegeneration. In vivo (31)P magnetic resonance spectroscopy combined with magnetization transfer (MT) is the sole approach able to noninvasively determine this ATP metabolic rate via measuring the forward ATPase reaction flux (F(f,ATPase)). However, previous studies indicate lack of quantitative agreement between F(f,ATPase) and oxidative metabolic rate in heart and liver. In contrast, recent work has shown that F(f,ATPase) might reflect oxidative phosphorylation rate in resting human brains. We have conducted an animal study, using rats under varied brain activity levels from light anesthesia to isoelectric state, to examine whether the in vivo (31)P MT approach is suitable for measuring the oxidative phosphorylation rate and its change associated with varied brain activity. Our results conclude that the measured F(f,ATPase) reflects the oxidative phosphorylation rate in resting rat brains, that this flux is tightly correlated to the change of energy demand under varied brain activity levels, and that a significant amount of ATP energy is required for "housekeeping" under the isoelectric state. These findings reveal distinguishable characteristics of ATP metabolism between the brain and heart, and they highlight the importance of in vivo (31)P MT approach to potentially provide a unique and powerful neuroimaging modality for noninvasively studying the cerebral ATP metabolic network and its central role in bioenergetics associated with brain function, activation, and diseases.},

abstract = {The modeling of isotope distributions can be used to evaluate intracellular fluxes and to investigate cellular metabolism. A method of modeling isotope distributions in biochemical networks that addresses some of the shortcomings of conventional methods is presented. Matrix equations representing steady state isotope balances are formulated for each metabolite and solved iteratively via computer. The key feature of this method is the use of atom mapping matrices, which decouple the generation of the steady state equations from the details of the transfer of carbon atoms from reactants to products. The use of atom mapping matrices results in a clear, intuitive description of metabolic networks that is easy to develop, check, and modify. A network representing energy metabolism in a hybridoma cell line was developed and presented as an example of the method. A program that uses the atom mapping matrix method to calculate the isotope distribution in the network as a function of the intracellular fluxes was written. Calculations showed that a single nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiment with C-13-labeled glucose should be able to uniquely determine two important TCA cycle flux ratios. These results demonstrate how in vitro NMR can be used to study cellular metabolism or to validate the flux estimates obtained from other methods.},

abstract = {Quantitative conceptual tools dealing with control and regulation of cellular processes have been mostly developed for and applied to the pathways of intermediary metabolism. Yet, cellular processes are organized in different levels, metabolism forming the lowest level in a cascade of processes. Well-known examples are the DNA-mRNA-enzyme-metabolism cascade and the signal transduction cascades consisting of covalent modification cycles. The reaction network that constitutes each level can be viewed as a "module" in which reactions are linked by mass transfer. Although in principle all of these cellular modules are ultimately linked by mass transfer, in practice they can often be regarded as "isolated" from each other in terms of mass transfer. Here modules can interact with each other only by means of regulatory or catalytic effects-a chemical species in one module may affect the rate of a reaction in another module by binding to an enzyme or transport system or by acting as a catalyst. This paper seeks to answer two questions about the control and regulation of such multi-level reaction networks: (i) How can the control properties of the system as a whole be expressed in terms of the control properties of individual modules and the effects between modules? (ii) How do the control properties of a module in its isolated state change when it is embedded in the whole system through its connections with the other modules? In order to answer these questions a quantitative theoretical framework is developed and applied to systems containing two, three or four fully interacting modules; it is shown how it can be extended in principle to n modules. This newly developed theory therefore makes it possible to quantitatively dissect intermodular, internal and external regulation in multi-level systems.},

We thermodynamically constrained reaction directionality in a multicompartmental genome-scale model of human metabolism, Recon 1, by calculating, in vivo, standard transformed reaction Gibbs energy as a function of compartment-specific pH, electrical potential, and ionic strength. We show that compartmental pH is an important determinant of thermodynamically determined reaction directionality. The effects of pH on transport reaction thermodynamics are only seen to their full extent when metabolites are represented as pseudoisomer groups of multiple protonated species. We accurately predict the irreversibility of 387 reactions, with detailed propagation of uncertainty in input data, and manually curate the literature to resolve conflicting directionality assignments. In at least half of all cases, a prediction of a reversible reaction directionality is due to the paucity of compartment-specific quantitative metabolomic data, with remaining cases due to uncertainty in estimation of standard reaction Gibbs energy. This study points to the pressing need for 1), quantitative metabolomic data, and 2), experimental measurement of thermochemical properties for human metabolites.},

abstract = {Epistasis refers to the phenomenon in which phenotypic consequences caused by mutation of one gene depend on one or more mutations at another gene. Epistasis is critical for understanding many genetic and evolutionary processes, including pathway organization, evolution of sexual reproduction, mutational load, ploidy, genomic complexity, speciation, and the origin of life. Nevertheless, current understandings for the genome-wide distribution of epistasis are mostly inferred from interactions among one mutant type per gene, whereas how epistatic interaction partners change dynamically for different mutant alleles of the same gene is largely unknown. Here we address this issue by combining predictions from flux balance analysis and data from a recently published high-throughput experiment. Our results show that different alleles can epistatically interact with very different gene sets. Furthermore, between two random mutant alleles of the same gene, the chance for the allele with more severe mutational consequence to develop a higher percentage of negative epistasis than the other allele is 50∼70\% in eukaryotic organisms, but only 20∼30\% in bacteria and archaea. We developed a population genetics model that predicts that the observed distribution for the sign of epistasis can speed up the process of purging deleterious mutations in eukaryotic organisms. Our results indicate that epistasis among genes can be dynamically rewired at the genome level, and call on future efforts to revisit theories that can integrate epistatic dynamics among genes in biological systems.},

However, the limited success of efforts to manipulate metabolic fluxes by rewiring the transcriptional network has cast doubt on the idea that transcript abundance controls metabolic fluxes. In this study, we investigate control of metabolic flux in the model bacterium Bacillus subtilis by quantifying fluxes, transcripts, and metabolites in eight metabolic states enforced by different environmental conditions. We find that most enzymes whose flux switches between on and off states, such as those involved in substrate uptake, exhibit large corresponding transcriptional changes. However, for the majority of enzymes in central metabolism, enzyme concentrations were insufficient to explain the observed fluxes[mdash]only for a number of reactions in the tricarboxylic acid cycle were enzyme changes approximately proportional to flux changes. Surprisingly, substrate changes revealed by metabolomics were also insufficient to explain observed fluxes, leaving a large role for allosteric regulation and enzyme modification in the control of metabolic fluxes.},

Compared with (13)C MRS studies, (11)C radiotracer measurements provide a single uptake curve representing the sum of all labeled metabolites, without chemical differentiation, but with higher temporal resolution. The reliability of the adjusted metabolic fluxes was analyzed with Monte-Carlo simulations using synthetic (11)C uptake curves, based on a typical arterial input function and previously published values of the neuroglial fluxes V(tca)(g), V(x), V(nt), and V(tca)(n) measured in dynamic (13)C MRS experiments. Assuming V(x)(g)=10 × V(tca)(g) and V(x)(n)=V(tca)(n), it was possible to assess the composite glial tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle flux V(gt)(g) (V(gt)(g)=V(x)(g) × V(tca)(g)/(V(x)(g)+V(tca)(g))) and the neurotransmission flux V(nt) from (11)C tissue-activity curves obtained within 30 minutes in the rat cortex with a beta-probe after a bolus infusion of [1-(11)C] acetate (n=9), resulting in V(gt)(g)=0.136±0.042 and V(nt)=0.170±0.103 $\mu$mol/g per minute (mean±s.d. of the group), in good agreement with (13)C MRS measurements.},

The reason is that static component concentrations, albeit extremely informative, do not contain functional information per se. The functional behavior of a network emerges only through the nonlinear gene, protein, and metabolite interactions across multiple metabolic and regulatory layers. I argue here that intracellular reaction rates are the functional end points of these interactions in metabolic networks, hence are highly relevant for systems biology. Methods for experimental determination of metabolic fluxes differ fundamentally from component concentration measurements; that is, intracellular reaction rates cannot be detected directly, but must be estimated through computer model-based interpretation of stable isotope patterns in products of metabolism.},

abstract = {Kinetic modelling of complex metabolic networks - a central goal of computational systems biology - is currently hampered by the lack of reliable rate equations for the majority of the underlying biochemical reactions and membrane transporters. On the basis of biochemically substantiated evidence that metabolic control is exerted by a narrow set of key regulatory enzymes, we propose here a hybrid modelling approach in which only the central regulatory enzymes are described by detailed mechanistic rate equations, and the majority of enzymes are approximated by simplified(non mechanistic) rate equations (e.g. mass action, LinLog, Michaelis-Menten and power law) capturing only a few basic kinetic features and hence containing only a small number of parameters to be experimentally determined. To check the reliability of this approach, we have applied it to two different metabolic networks, the energy and redox metabolism of red blood cells, and the purine metabolism of hepatocytes, using in both cases available comprehensive mechanistic models as reference standards. Identification of the central regulatory enzymes was performed by employing only information on network topology and the metabolic data for a single reference state of the network [Grimbs S, Selbig J, Bulik S, Holzhutter HG \& Steuer R (2007) Mol Syst Biol 3, 146, doi:10.1038/msb4100186].Calculations of stationary and temporary states under various physiological challenges demonstrate the good performance of the hybrid models. We propose the hybrid modelling approach as a means to speed up the development of reliable kinetic models for complex metabolic networks.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: The problem of reverse engineering the dynamics of gene expression profiles is of focal importance in systems biology. Due to noise and the inherent lack of sufficiently large datasets generated via high-throughput measurements, known reconstruction frameworks based on dynamical systems models fail to provide adequate settings for network analysis. This motivates the study of new approaches that produce stochastic lists of explanations for the observed network dynamics that can be efficiently inferred from small sample sets and in the presence of errors. RESULTS: We introduce a novel algebraic modeling framework, termed stochastic polynomial dynamical systems (SPDSs) that can capture the dynamics of regulatory networks based on microarray expression data. Here, we refer to dynamics of the network as the trajectories of gene expression profiles over time. The model assumes that the expression data is quantized in a manner that allows for imposing a finite field structure on the observations, and the existence of polynomial update functions for each gene in the network. The underlying reverse engineering algorithm is based on ideas borrowed from coding theory, and in particular, list-decoding methods for so called Reed-Muller codes. The list-decoding method was tested on synthetic data and on microarray expression measurements from the M(3D) database, corresponding to a subnetwork of the Escherichia coli SOS repair system, as well as on the complete transcription factor network, available at RegulonDB. The results show that SPDSs constructed via list-decoders significantly outperform other algebraic reverse engineering methods, and that they also provide good guidelines for estimating the influence of genes on the dynamics of the network. AVAILABILITY: Software codes for list-decoding algorithms suitable for direct application to quantized expression data will be publicly available at the authors' web-pages.},

The causes for the Warburg effect have remained a subject of considerable controversy since its discovery over 80 years ago, with several competing hypotheses. Here, utilizing a genome-scale human metabolic network model accounting for stoichiometric and enzyme solvent capacity considerations, we show that the Warburg effect is a direct consequence of the metabolic adaptation of cancer cells to increase biomass production rate. The analysis is shown to accurately capture a three phase metabolic behavior that is observed experimentally during oncogenic progression, as well as a prominent characteristic of cancer cells involving their preference for glutamine uptake over other amino acids.},

abstract = {An important goal of whole-cell computational modeling is to integrate detailed biochemical information with biological intuition to produce testable predictions. Based on the premise that prokaryotes such as Escherichia coli have maximized their growth performance along evolution, flux balance analysis (FBA) predicts metabolic flux distributions at steady state by using linear programming. Corroborating earlier results, we show that recent intracellular flux data for wild-type E. coli JM101 display excellent agreement with FBA predictions. Although the assumption of optimality for a wild-type bacterium is justifiable, the same argument may not be valid for genetically engineered knockouts or other bacterial strains that were not exposed to long-term evolutionary pressure. We address this point by introducing the method of minimization of metabolic adjustment (MOMA), whereby we test the hypothesis that knockout metabolic fluxes undergo a minimal redistribution with respect to the flux configuration of the wild type. MOMA employs quadratic programming to identify a point in flux space, which is closest to the wild-type point, compatibly with the gene deletion constraint. Comparing MOMA and FBA predictions to experimental flux data for E. coli pyruvate kinase mutant PB25, we find that MOMA displays a significantly higher correlation than FBA. Our method is further supported by experimental data for E. coli knockout growth rates. It can therefore be used for predicting the behavior of perturbed metabolic networks, whose growth performance is in general suboptimal. MOMA and its possible future extensions may be useful in understanding the evolutionary optimization of metabolism.},

abstract = {A major goal of post-genomic biology is to reconstruct and model in silico the metabolic networks of entire organisms. Work on bacteria is well advanced, and is now under way for plants and other eukaryotes. Genome-scale modelling in plants is much more challenging than in bacteria. The challenges come from features characteristic of higher organisms (subcellular compartmentation, tissue differentiation) and also from the particular severity in plants of a general problem: genome content whose functions remain undiscovered. This problem results in thousands of genes for which no function is known ('undiscovered genome content') and hundreds of enzymatic and transport functions for which no gene is yet identified. The severity of the undiscovered genome content problem in plants reflects their genome size and complexity. To bring the challenges of plant genome-scale modelling into focus, we first summarize the current status of plant genome-scale models. We then highlight the challenges - and ways to address them - in three areas: identifying genes for missing processes, modelling tissues as opposed to single cells, and finding metabolic functions encoded by undiscovered genome content. We also discuss the emerging view that a significant fraction of undiscovered genome content encodes functions that counter damage to metabolites inflicted by spontaneous chemical reactions or enzymatic mistakes.},

abstract = {Metabolic flux analysis (MFA) has so far been restricted to lumped networks lacking many important pathways, partly due to the difficulty in automatically generating isotope mapping matrices for genome-scale metabolic networks. Here we introduce a procedure that uses a compound matching algorithm based on the graph theoretical concept of pattern recognition along with relevant reaction information to automatically generate genome-scale atom mappings which trace the path of atoms from reactants to products for every reaction. The procedure is applied to the iAF1260 metabolic reconstruction of Escherichia coli yielding the genome-scale isotope mapping model imPR90068. This model maps 90,068 non-hydrogen atoms that span all 2,077 reactions present in iAF1260 (previous largest mapping model included 238 reactions). The expanded scope of the isotope mapping model allows the complete tracking of labeled atoms through pathways such as cofactor and prosthetic group biosynthesis and histidine metabolism. An EMU representation of imPR90068 is also constructed and made available.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:The quantitative analysis of metabolic fluxes, i.e., in vivo activities of intracellular enzymes and pathways, provides key information on biological systems in systems biology and metabolic engineering. It is based on a comprehensive approach combining (i) tracer cultivation on 13C substrates, (ii) 13C labelling analysis by mass spectrometry and (iii) mathematical modelling for experimental design, data processing, flux calculation and statistics. Whereas the cultivation and the analytical part is fairly advanced, a lack of appropriate modelling software solutions for all modelling aspects in flux studies is limiting the application of metabolic flux analysis.RESULTS:We have developed OpenFLUX as a user friendly, yet flexible software application for small and large scale 13C metabolic flux analysis. The application is based on the new Elementary Metabolite Unit (EMU) framework, significantly enhancing computation speed for flux calculation. From simple notation of metabolic reaction networks defined in a spreadsheet, the OpenFLUX parser automatically generates MATLAB-readable metabolite and isotopomer balances, thus strongly facilitating model creation. The model can be used to perform experimental design, parameter estimation and sensitivity analysis either using the built-in gradient-based search or Monte Carlo algorithms or in user-defined algorithms. Exemplified for a microbial flux study with 71 reactions, 8 free flux parameters and mass isotopomer distribution of 10 metabolites, OpenFLUX allowed to automatically compile the EMU-based model from an Excel file containing metabolic reactions and carbon transfer mechanisms, showing it's user-friendliness. It reliably reproduced the published data and optimum flux distributions for the network under study were found quickly (<20 sec).CONCLUSION:We have developed a fast, accurate application to perform steady-state 13C metabolic flux analysis. OpenFLUX will strongly facilitate and enhance the design, calculation and interpretation of metabolic flux studies. By providing the software open source, we hope it will evolve with the rapidly growing field of fluxomics.},

@article{Zamboni2005,
abstract = {BACKGROUND:Quantitative knowledge of intracellular fluxes is important for a comprehensive characterization of metabolic networks and their functional operation. In contrast to direct assessment of metabolite concentrations, in vivo metabolite fluxes must be inferred indirectly from measurable quantities in 13C experiments. The required experience, the complicated network models, large and heterogeneous data sets, and the time-consuming set-up of highly controlled experimental conditions largely restricted metabolic flux analysis to few expert groups. A conceptual simplification of flux analysis is the analytical determination of metabolic flux ratios exclusively from MS data, which can then be used in a second step to estimate absolute in vivo fluxes.RESULTS:Here we describe the user-friendly software package FiatFlux that supports flux analysis for non-expert users. In the first module, ratios of converging fluxes are automatically calculated from GC-MS-detected 13C-pattern in protein-bound amino acids. Predefined fragmentation patterns are automatically identified and appropriate statistical data treatment is based on the comparison of redundant information in the MS spectra. In the second module, absolute intracellular fluxes may be calculated by a 13C-constrained flux balancing procedure that combines experimentally determined fluxes in and out of the cell and the above flux ratios. The software is preconfigured to derive flux ratios and absolute in vivo fluxes from [1-13C] and [U-13C]glucose experiments and GC-MS analysis of amino acids for a variety of microorganisms.CONCLUSION:FiatFlux is an intuitive tool for quantitative investigations of intracellular metabolism by users that are not familiar with numerical methods or isotopic tracer experiments. The aim of this open source software is to enable non-specialists to adapt the software to their specific scientific interests, including other 13C-substrates, labeling mixtures, and organisms.},

We found that negative epistasis occurs mainly between nonessential reactions with overlapping functions, whereas positive epistasis usually involves essential reactions, is highly abundant and, unexpectedly, often occurs between reactions without overlapping functions. We offer mechanistic explanations of these findings and experimentally validate them for 61 S. cerevisiae gene pairs.},

This double-negative feedback loop is part of a bistable trigger that makes the transition into mitosis abrupt and decisive. To generate a bistable response, some component of a double-negative feedback loop must exhibit an ultrasensitive response to its upstream regulator. Here, we experimentally demonstrate that Wee1 exhibits a highly ultrasensitive response to Cdk1. Several mechanisms can, in principle, give rise to ultrasensitivity, including zero-order effects, multisite phosphorylation, and competition mechanisms. We found that the ultrasensitivity in the inactivation of Wee1 arises mainly through two competition mechanisms: competition between two sets of phosphorylation sites in Wee1 and between Wee1 and other high-affinity Cdk1 targets. Based on these findings, we were able to reconstitute a highly ultrasensitive Wee1 response with purified components. Competition provides a simple way of generating the equivalent of a highly cooperative allosteric response.},

@article{Pomerening2008a,
abstract = {In Xenopus embryos, the cell cycle is driven by an autonomous biochemical oscillator that controls the periodic activation and inactivation of cyclin B1-CDK1. The oscillator circuit includes a system of three interlinked positive and double-negative feedback loops (CDK1 -> Cdc25 -> CDK1; CDK1 -/ Wee1 -/ CDK1; and CDK1 -/ Myt1 -/ CDK1) that collectively function as a bistable trigger. Previous work established that this bistable trigger is essential for CDK1 oscillations in the early embryonic cell cycle. Here, we assess the importance of the trigger in the somatic cell cycle, where checkpoints and additional regulatory mechanisms could render it dispensable. Our approach was to express the phosphorylation site mutant CDK1AF, which short-circuits the feedback loops, in HeLa cells, and to monitor cell cycle progression by live cell fluorescence microscopy. We found that CDK1AF-expressing cells carry out a relatively normal first mitosis, but then undergo rapid cycles of cyclin B1 accumulation and destruction at intervals of 3-6 h. During these cycles, the cells enter and exit M phase-like states without carrying out cytokinesis or karyokinesis. Phenotypically similar rapid cycles were seen in Wee1 knockdown cells. These findings show that the interplay between CDK1, Wee1/Myt1, and Cdc25 is required for the establishment of G1 phase, for the normal approximately 20-h cell cycle period, and for the switch-like oscillations in cyclin B1 abundance characteristic of the somatic cell cycle. We propose that the HeLa cell cycle is built upon an unreliable negative feedback oscillator and that the normal high reliability, slow pace and switch-like character of the cycle is imposed by a bistable CDK1/Wee1/Myt1/Cdc25 system.},

abstract = {This work concerns the cause of glycolytic oscillations in yeast. We analyse experimental data as well as models in two distinct cases: the relaxation-like oscillations seen in yeast extracts, and the sinusoidal Hopf oscillations seen in intact yeast cells. In the case of yeast extracts, we use flux-change plots and model analyses to establish that the oscillations are driven by on/off switching of phosphofructokinase. In the case of intact yeast cells, we find that the instability leading to the appearance of oscillations is caused by the stoichiometry of the ATP-ADP-AMP system and the allosteric regulation of phosphofructokinase, whereas frequency control is distributed over the reaction network. Notably, the NAD+/NADH ratio modulates the frequency of the oscillations without affecting the instability. This is important for understanding the mutual synchronization of oscillations in the individual yeast cells, as synchronization is believed to occur via acetaldehyde, which in turn affects the frequency of oscillations by changing this ratio.},

abstract = {In the present work dynamic changes of free intracellular amino acid pools during autonomous oscillations of Saccharomyces cerevisiae were quantified in glucose-limited continuous cultivations. At a dilution rate of D = 0.22 h(-1) cyclic changes with a period of 120 min were found for many variables such as carbon dioxide production rate, dissolved oxygen, pH, biomass content, and various metabolite concentrations. On the basis of the observed dynamic patterns, free intracellular amino acids were classified to show oscillatory, stationary, or chaotic behavior. Amino acid pools such as serine, alanine, valine, leucine, or lysine were subjected to clear oscillations with a frequency of 120 min, identical to that of other described cultivation variables, indicating that there is a direct correlation between the periodic changes of amino acid concentrations and the metabolic oscillations on the cellular level. The oscillations of these amino acids were unequally phase-delayed and had different amplitudes of oscillation. Accordingly, they exhibited different patterns in phase plane plots vs. intracellular trehalose. Despite the complex and marked metabolic changes during oscillation, selected intracellular amino acids such as histidine, threonine, isoleucine, or arginine remained about constant. Concentrations of glutamate and glutamine showed a chaotic behavior. However, the ratio of glutamate to glutamine concentration was found to be oscillatory, with a period of 60 min and a corresponding figure eight-shaped pattern in a plot vs. trehalose concentration. Considering the described diversity, it can be concluded that the observed periodic changes are neither just the consequence of low or high rates of protein biosynthesis/degradation nor correlated to changing cell volumes during oscillation. The ratio between doubling time (189 min) and period of oscillation of intracellular amino acids (120 min) was 1:6. The fact that there is a close relationship between doubling time and period of oscillation underlines that the described autonomous oscillations are cell-cycle-associated.},

abstract = {This paper addresses some questions related to the evolution of cooperative behaviors, in the context of energetic metabolism. Glycolysis can perform either under a dissipative working regime suitable for rapid proliferation or under an efficient regime that entails a good modus operandi under conditions of glucose shortage. A cellular mechanism allowing switching between these two regimes may represent an evolutionary achievement. Thus, we have explored the conditions that might have favored the emergence of such an accommodative mechanism. Because of an inevitable conflict for resources between individual interests and the common good, rapid and inefficient use of glucose is always favored by natural selection in spatially homogeneous environment, regardless of the external conditions. In contrast, when the space is structured, the behavior of the system is determined by its free energy content. If the fuel is abundant, the dissipative strategy dominates the space. However, under famine conditions the efficient regime represents an evolutionary stable strategy in a Harmony game. Between these two extreme situations, both metabolic regimes are engaged in a Prisoner's Dilemma game, where the output depends on the extracellular free energy. The energy transition values that lead from one domain to another have been calculated. We conclude that an accommodative mechanism permitting alternation between dissipative and efficient regimes might have evolved in heterogeneous and highly fluctuating environments. Overall, the current work shows how evolutionary optimization and game-theoretical approaches can be complementary in providing useful insights into biochemical systems.},

abstract = {Our understanding of the molecular structure and function in the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, surpasses that of all other eukaryotic cells. However, the fundamental properties of the complex processes and their control systems have been difficult to reconstruct from detailed dissection of their molecular components. Spontaneous oscillatory dynamics observed in self-synchronized continuous cultures is pervasive, involves much of the cellular network, and provides unique insights into integrative cell physiology. Here, in non-invasive experiments in vivo, we exploit these oscillatory dynamics to analyse the global timing of the cellular network to show the presence of a low-order chaotic component. Although robust to a wide range of environmental perturbations, the system responds and reacts to the imposition of harsh environmental conditions, in this case low pH, by dynamic re-organization of respiration, and this feeds upwards to affect cell division. These complex dynamics can be represented by a tuneable attractor that orchestrates cellular complexity and coherence to the environment.},

However, many biological oscillators also have a positive feedback loop, raising the question of what advantages the extra loop imparts. Through computational studies, we show that it is generally difficult to adjust a negative feedback oscillator's frequency without compromising its amplitude, whereas with positive-plus-negative feedback, one can achieve a widely tunable frequency and near-constant amplitude. This tunability makes the latter design suitable for biological rhythms like heartbeats and cell cycles that need to provide a constant output over a range of frequencies. Positive-plus-negative oscillators also appear to be more robust and easier to evolve, rationalizing why they are found in contexts where an adjustable frequency is unimportant.},

@article{Wittmann2005a,
abstract = {In the present work LC-MS/MS was applied to measure the concentrations of intermediates of glycolysis and TCA cycle during autonomous, cell-cycle synchronized oscillations in aerobic, glucose-limited chemostat cultures of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This study complements previously reported oscillations in carbon dioxide production rate, intracellular concentrations of trehalose and various free amino acids, and extracellular acetate and pyruvate in the same culture. Of the glycolytic intermediates, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, 2- and 3-phosphoglycerate, and phosphoenolpyruvate show the most pronounced oscillatory behavior, the latter three compounds oscillating out of phase with the former. This agrees with previously observed metabolic control by phosphofructokinase and pyruvate kinase. Although individually not clearly oscillating, several intermediates of the TCA cycle, i.e., alpha-ketoglutarate, succinate, fumarate, and malate, exhibited increasing concentration during the cell cycle phase with high carbon flux through glycolysis and TCA cycle. The average mass action ratios of beta-phosphoglucomutase and fumarase agreed well with previously determined in vitro equilibrium constants. Minor differences resulted for phosphoglucose isomerase and enolase. Together with the observed close correlation of the pool sizes of the involved metabolites, this might indicate that, in vivo, these reactions are operating close to equilibrium, whereby care must be taken due to possible differences between in vivo and in vitro conditions. Combining the data with previously determined intracellular amino acid levels from the same culture, a few clear correlations between catabolism and anabolism could be identified: phosphoglycerate/serine and alpha-ketoglutarate/lysine exhibited correlated oscillatory behavior, albeit with different phase shifts. Oscillations in intracellular amino acids might therefore be, at least partly, following oscillations of their anabolic precursors.},

The genetic switch controlling the yeast galactose use pathway includes two paralogous genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that encode a co-inducer (GAL3) and a galactokinase (GAL1). These paralogues arose from a single bifunctional ancestral gene as is still present in Kluyveromyces lactis. To determine which evolutionary processes shaped the evolution of the two paralogues, here we assess the effects of precise replacement of coding and non-coding sequences on organismal fitness. We suggest that duplication of the ancestral bifunctional gene allowed for the resolution of an adaptive conflict between the transcriptional regulation of the two gene functions. After duplication, previously disfavoured binding site configurations evolved that divided the regulation of the ancestral gene into two specialized genes, one of which ultimately became one of the most tightly regulated genes in the genome.},

abstract = {The transcription factors responsible for maintaining circadian rhythm influence a variety of biological processes. Recently, it has been suggested that the core circadian genes may play a role in breast tumorigenesis, possibly by influencing hormone regulation or other pathways relevant to cancer. To evaluate this hypothesis, we conducted a genetic and epigenetic association study, as well as a transcriptional profiling array and a pathway-based network analysis. We report significant correlations between single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with the central circadian regulator CLOCK and breast cancer risk, with apparent effect modification by estrogen receptor/progesterone receptor status. We also found that hypermethylation in the CLOCK promoter reduced the risk of breast cancer, and lower levels of CLOCK expression were documented in healthy controls relative to normal or tumor tissue from patients with breast cancer. Finally, we silenced CLOCK in vitro and performed a whole-genome expression microarray and pathway analysis, which identified a cancer-relevant network of transcripts with altered expression following CLOCK gene knockdown. Our findings support the hypothesis that circadian genes influence tumorigenesis, and identify a set of circadian gene variants as candidate breast cancer susceptibility biomarkers.

Almost one century ago, Otto Warburg proposed the hypothesis that mitochondrial function might be impaired in cancer cells. However, his hypothesis was never demonstrated in human carcinomas. In this study, we have analyzed the expression of the beta-catalytic subunit of the H+-ATP synthase (beta-F1-ATPase) of mitochondria in carcinomas of the human liver, kidney, and colon. We show that carcinogenesis in the liver involves a depletion of the cellular mitochondrial content, as revealed by reduced content of mitochondrial markers, whereas in kidney and colon carcinomas, it involves a selective repression of the expression of the beta-F1-ATPase concurrent with an increase in the expression of the glycolytic glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Both mechanisms limit mitochondrial cellular activity in cancer, strongly supporting Warburg's hypothesis, and suggest a mechanism for the resistance and compromised apoptotic potential of tumor cells. Furthermore, we show that the metabolic state of the cell, as defined by a bioenergetic mitochondrial index relative to the cellular glycolytic potential, provides a signature of carcinogenesis of prognostic value in assessing the progression of colorectal carcinomas.},

abstract = {After whole-genome duplication (WGD), deletions return most loci to single copy. However, duplicate loci may survive through selection for increased dosage. Here, we show how the WGD increased copy number of some glycolytic genes could have conferred an almost immediate selective advantage to an ancestor of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, providing a rationale for the success of the WGD. We propose that the loss of other redundant genes throughout the genome resulted in incremental dosage increases for the surviving duplicated glycolytic genes. This increase gave post-WGD yeasts a growth advantage through rapid glucose fermentation; one of this lineage's many adaptations to glucose-rich environments. Our hypothesis is supported by data from enzyme kinetics and comparative genomics. Because changes in gene dosage follow directly from post-WGD deletions, dosage selection can confer an almost instantaneous benefit after WGD, unlike neofunctionalization or subfunctionalization, which require specific mutations. We also show theoretically that increased fermentative capacity is of greatest advantage when glucose resources are both large and dense, an observation potentially related to the appearance of angiosperms around the time of WGD.},

@article{Chen2009a,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: The unique metabolism of tumors was described many years ago by Otto Warburg, who identified tumor cells with increased glycolysis and decreased mitochondrial activity. However, "aerobic glycolysis" generates fewer ATP per glucose molecule than mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, so in terms of energy production, it is unclear how increasing a less efficient process provides tumors with a growth advantage. METHODS/FINDINGS: We carried out a screen for loss of genetic elements in pancreatic tumor cells that accelerated their growth as tumors, and identified mitochondrial ribosomal protein L28 (MRPL28). Knockdown of MRPL28 in these cells decreased mitochondrial activity, and increased glycolysis, but paradoxically, decreased cellular growth in vitro. Following Warburg's observations, this mutation causes decreased mitochondrial function, compensatory increase in glycolysis and accelerated growth in vivo. Likewise, knockdown of either mitochondrial ribosomal protein L12 (MRPL12) or cytochrome oxidase had a similar effect. Conversely, expression of the mitochondrial uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) increased oxygen consumption and decreased tumor growth. Finally, treatment of tumor bearing animals with dichloroacetate (DCA) increased pyruvate consumption in the mitochondria, increased total oxygen consumption, increased tumor hypoxia and slowed tumor growth. CONCLUSIONS: We interpret these findings to show that non-oncogenic genetic changes that alter mitochondrial metabolism can regulate tumor growth through modulation of the consumption of oxygen, which appears to be a rate limiting substrate for tumor proliferation.},

Time dependence of pHi was monitored by 31P-NMR on the whole cell population. Microspectrofluorimetry, after loading of the cells with SNARF-1, enabled the determination of pHi in isolated cells and its distribution among the cell population. By this method, the vacuolar pH could not be distinguished from the cytoplasmic pH in C. albicans blastospores, but alkalization of pHi was observed at the beginning of germ tubes. The absolute values of pHi determined by 31P-NMR were slightly different from those obtained by laser microspectrofluorimetry. However, the pH distributions in the cell population were converging. For blastospores in exponential phase a gaussian distribution of pHi was observed with both methods, the cells maintained a steady pHi value when the external pH was varied from 5.5 to 8.5. For cells in stationary phase two pools were identified: the combination of the two techniques demonstrated the presence of two different subpopulations. One of these population (with lower pH) was able to commute to the other one with time as shown by 31P-NMR kinetics. This information is reported here for the first time in C. albicans.},
