Although the logic in the main text may be straightforward, we show
here in more verbosity that Algorithm~\ref{alg:ReductionToCNF} works
as described.

\begin{Theorem}
\label{thm:ReductionToCNF}
Algorithm~\ref{alg:ReductionToCNF} returns the disjunction with
minimum expression value among all disjunctions of a rule in CNF.
\end{Theorem}

\begin{proof}
The third step in the while-loop does not affect the
underlying logic, so we only need to consider the effect of step one
on step two.  Let us first consider when expressions $x_1, ..., x_4$
are all literals in step two to cover the most complex case, and that
$x_i^{(e)}$ denotes the expression measurement for gene $x_i$. Assume
WLOG that $x_1 \lor x_3$ attains the minimum expression among the
disjunctions. Then we have:

\begin{align*}
&x_{1}^{(e)} + x_{3}^{(e)} \leq x_{1}^{(e)} + x_{4}^{(e)} \Rightarrow x_{3}^{(e)} \leq x_{4}^{(e)} \\
&x_{1}^{(e)} + x_{3}^{(e)} \leq x_{2}^{(e)} + x_{3}^{(e)} \Rightarrow x_{1}^{(e)} \leq x_{2}^{(e)} 
\end{align*}

Applying this result in conjunction to step one in the while-loop to
the original expression, $(x_1 \land x_2) \lor (x_3 \land x_4)$, we
immediately arrive at $(x_1) \lor (x_3)$, which gives our originally
assumed minimum. To show that this result doesn't depend on the $x_i$
being literals, merely consider repeating this process recursively for
each $x_i$ that is not a literal to arrive at two different
evaluations for $x_i^{(e)}$ (one where each evaluation is done with reduction, 
and one where we evaluate entirely without reduction). 
Since the process cannot continue
indefinitely, eventually there is a base case involving only literals,
and the above result shows that, at each step, as we backtrack from the base case,
both evaluations will be identical. The desired result is obtained
because Algorithm~\ref{alg:ReductionToCNF} without step one simply yields CNF,
and it follows that adding step one will yield the disjunction with 
minimum expression value of the rule in CNF.
\end{proof}
